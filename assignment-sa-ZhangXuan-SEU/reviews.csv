We were greeted as IHG reward members. The room was beautiful, very spacious and the furniture looked very modern. The bed was so comfortable, we don't usually sleep in a King Bed at home so this was a nice treat and we were satisfied with every aspect of the stay.\n\nThe housekeeping and breakfast staff were friendly. The complimentary breakfast in the morning was fantastic. A lot of variety and options to get you going in the morning. I got a coffee and was surprised there was a hazelnut flavor I could put in for an extra touch. The pancake machine was working and was a hit for my boyfriend.\n\nTo top all of this off, my boyfriend left his glasses in the room which we only realized when we got home. I gave the hotel a call, they said they would verify with housekeeping and give us a call back. Kate called us back within 5 minutes of receiving the call, she found the glasses and will be sending them to us through the mail. I was impressed with how fast our request was answered. \n\nConveniently located to a few good fast food spots, a shoppers and a bulk barn, it made all of our basic needs within steps from the hotel.

Our preferred choice of the Holiday Inn, waterfront was fully booked, as were many other hotels, but this place turned out to be a great choice. It is conveniently located just off the 401, 2 exits nearby, just in case you miss one. \nCheck in was fast and the room was quite large and well appointed, with the exception of a room safe. Valuables, passports etc can be deposited at reception. The location is busy, but not at all noisy and located next to a Shell station and very close to nearby shops and eateries. There is no restaurant on site, fortunately only a one minute walk to Dennys next door or a few extra minutes to East Side Marios is OK. If you want something a bit more fancy, then a short drive to your choice. The LCBO is nearby, within walking distance, if you need refreshments.\nThe nearby Outlet Mall is worth a visit, as is Kingston town centre, waterfront etc etc.\nThe hotel itself was very clean, seemed to be well maintained and well sound insulated. The indoor pool was adequate in winter when we visited, but could become a bit crowded in summer months. \nThe bed was very large and comfy. Other items included a large, flat screen TV, 3 or 4 cu ft fridge and coffee making. Bathroom had a full bath plus overhead shower. All in all, a decent room, away from home. \nBreakfast is a serve yourself type with cereals, selection of hot items, also an ingenious auto pancake maker, along with the usual drinks, fruit and yogurts. Not the best of selections but adequate for a few days away. If you want something more substantial, there is an Eggsquis a few kms away, along with others that you can find with Google etc.",4,positive

The cable company advertised movies on demand, but we had only a TV remote. We decided to call the front desk, but they did not pick up after repeated calls. Finally, I went down to ask. I found the two clerks chatting away and couldn't understand why they didn't pick up the phone. They informed me that they didn't have movie rentals, we only get the cable package of 38 programs. \n\nOne other minor complaint - the toilet paper was wafer thin. \n\nHoliday Inn Express is trying to pitch its brand as a step above the typical two star chains like Days Inn and Comfort Inn.

The location was great as there were plenty of restaurants and shopping very close by.\nThere were two downfalls however. First, our team was scattered all over the hotel instead of being placed in rooms together even though we had all booked over a month in advance. They maybe did this to limit the amount of noise but since the kids wanted to be together, there was an excessive amount of running between rooms\u002Ffloors. Secondly, because we booked as a team, there was a two night minimum stay. Even though our tournament was over in the early afternoon, we had to stay the night. A few parents had heard about this and cancelled their \""team\"" room and just booked a regular room for the one night. Also, the Government rate was not applied for Government employees on the team.",4,positive

The hotel claimed they didn't have my reservation so I had to pay twice, to say I was furious would be an understatement. I was given an accessible room when I certainly had no need for one. The one was dusty and the cleanliness of the bathroom left a lot to be desired. The lighting in the bathroom was horrible, way too dim, almost like being in the dark. But the worst of it was the awful loud annouying sound in the hotel that kept us up all night.

I travel a lot so have a good sense of where the bar is set.\n\nThis hotel is new and in great shape. I found it clean and well maintained. The hotel looks like the online photographs, which is not always the case when you travel. \n\nIt is right off the highway so getting on your way in the morning is easy. I have stayed at hotels further in town and let me tell you getting around with all the road construction over the last couple of years is not fun. It can take 20 minutes or more just to get back the 401. Parking can be an issue downtown, with restricted overnight road parking and pay per use hotel lots. Parking here is at the door and free.\n\nDidn't use the amenities, but popped my head in for a quick look. Looked good. The rooms were a good size, updated and clean.\n\nBreakfast. I loved it. Not having to get dressed and drive some where in the morning is a bonus. The Breakfast lounge is on the main floor and is is spacious. There are different seating options depending the number in you party and lots of windows for bright light. Did I mention it is spacious, not a big fan of the small nooks where you have to fight for space and a seat. Not the case here. The food was hot and well stocked and included the usual cereal, toast, eggs, meat, drinks, fresh fruit etc. There was something for everyone. and no line ups.\n\nI also appreciated the number of other close at hand eating options. With in a few hundred yards of the hotel the is Pizza Hut, Wendy's, Tim Horton's, Dairy Queen, Mc Donald's, Arbys, KFc and... well you get the idea..lots of choice close at hand.\n\nSpeaking of close at hand there are two gas stations a Shoppers Drug mart a No Frills Grocery and a Canadian Tire right across the street. Im sure I've missed things but again, you get the idea that everything's close at hand. I did not find this the case when I stayed downtown.

The supervisor is in need of a major attitude adjustment.  Perhaps a course in basic customer service would be a starter.   Just a suggestion.  Seems obvious for the hotel business, but not so much at this location.  \n\nHotel is not clean.  Surprising for a HIEX, I know.  Our bathroom floor had not been cleaned from the last customer.   I took it in stride, giving the benefit of the doubt.  We are all human and things can get overlooked.  I very kindly asked if someone could clean it.  They did send a guy up.  Suffice it to say, he didn't clean the floor.  We went back in and the same bits of tissue paper and hair....Sooooooooooooo gross...We're still there!!!  Back down I go.  Said it hadn't been cleaned.  Front desk girl said it was clean.  I said again that it wasn't and maybe she would like to see it.  She said no, it was clean.   Fine.  Clearly I was getting nowhere and would have to clean it myself.  \n\nTook a shower.  So did my daughter. Both of us got scalded with hot water off and on.  Half the holes in the shower head were plugged, so the water pressure was super weak too.  Maybe just as well considering the blasts of burning hot water when other rooms were flushing or whatever.\n\nSo the second night of our stay, I had told front desk girl about the water.  She said, \""Maintenance said there is no reason for any water problems.  And I believe him.\"" Her tone and body language spoke volumes too.  She said maybe we should switch rooms to find one that could meet my standards.  I said well maybe just meeting Holiday Inn standards would be a start.  She also refused to accept that the carpets in the halls had not been vacuumed. normally, I wouldn't care about that, but given the horrible service and room situation, I told her about it.  She said they are clean.  So I took pictures. Lol.  Not so much.\n\nLinens at this location are worn and yellowed.  Not too appealing. Beds were reasonably comfy though.\n\n One of the breakfast ladies appears to not enjoy her job.   Oh, and if you like the trademark cin buns...Forget about it.   They take the food away before breakfast ends.  We asked for cin buns fifteen mins before it ended because they were all out.  One said she would bring more.  Nope.  It's a little thing, but given the whole experience....Just another blunder.\n\nTo top it all off, when I checked out, front desk girl, who I don't think knows how to smile, started to give me a lesson on what the destination tax charge they whacked onto my receipt was for.  I told her that that tax is questionable at best and that it isn't being properly overseen.  She started into a lecture, which I declined to stay for.  Lol.  She did remove the tax though, as it is voluntary.  \n\nDo yourself a big favour.  Stay at the  Courtyard my Marriott which is right there too. Much nicer hotel and no more expensive.  I stayed there the third night away.  \n\nNormally I like Expresses, but this one is a colossal mess, across the board.   \n\nIf you dare to stay, take your own vacuum, cleaning rag and breakfast.  Oh, and unlike McDonald's, the smiles are not free. In fact, they are non-existent.   At least at the Bates Motel, Norman smiles at guests.",1,negative

It came with a sofa bed in the living area but there was no separating door between the king bedroom and living area. Room was fairly spacious with a nice size bathroom. King bed was very comfortable and I actually slept through the 2 nights we were there without waking once! The sofa bed was unfortunately thin and not comfortable. When we called reception for help to maybe provide an extra mattress, they kindly offered to change rooms for us. However it was late and we weren't sure if the sofa bed in the other room also had a similar situation. So we asked for extra blankets to pad the sofa bed and it definitely helped! Really appreciated the help from the reception at around 11pm (think his name was Jason) and the trouble he took to help us find a good solution. Breakfast was good but the breakfast area can get very crowded if you came down a little late. But we just waited a while and a nice lady offered to finish her coffee in her room and let us have her table. Food spread was quite good and we definitely enjoyed our breakfast! Location of the hotel is just off the 401 highway but just far enough so that you can't hear the traffic noise. Liked the quiet and it had a good ambience. Was just about 15 mins  drive to downtown Kingston and you get to still stay in a nice suburban area. What we really appreciated about the hotel when we got there was that there were no flies around the place, probably because it was too far inland. The flies were plentiful and quite annoying when we were at the restaurants in downtown Kingston - they were everywhere, on the tables, dropped into our water and even onto our food! Even walking around the streets near the lake was not fun as you could suddenly walk into a swarm of the insects without realising it until it was too late! We were so glad that we booked a hotel away from the lake area which was supposed to be the prime locations in Kingston. Perhaps it was the time of the year? The hotel was also convenient in that there were shops and eating places all around us. Just behind the hotel was Dennys - a family restaurant with fairly good food and decent prices (for seniors, get the above 55's specials!). Just around the corner were some outlet shops like Tommy Hilfiger, Levis', etc. as well as almost every conceivable fast food restaurant you can think of (and more)! As you can imagine, this hotel is very popular and parking can be tight if you came back late. But there were more carpark spaces in the rear with just a short walk to the hotel side entrance.

Commenting to the parents who were as grossly obese as their kids resulted in a yelling row of insults from the rude mother.

There is a gym and swimming pool as well. It is strange that they do charge 5 dollars for parking.",5,positive

Wow, so I take the points on that one. I have no idea if we actually received an upgraded room as the hotel doesn\u2019t appear to have anything nicer than very standard rooms in every way. Not even so much as a bottle of water or a note on checkin. For reference in the middle of Taiwan at Holliday Inn Express (both Taichung and Taoyuan) I received beautifully hand written notes in English thanking me for choosing their hotel. It was touching and human, here the guy couldn\u2019t be more perfunctory if he tried. I don\u2019t know where to start, here are a few examples of incompetence we were on the receiving end of in all of the 2 hours we have been here so far:\n- we call down for pillow, he brings pillows with no pillow cases, then comes back later with the pillow cases, I suppose they were meant to be DIYs (I am paying for this room am I not?)\n- we ask to have suit pressed for a funeral we are going to, no help but apparently there is a dry cleaner by the McDonalds down the street.\n- finally, in 2018, the rooms feature new 40\u201D flat panel displays...with 1970\u2019s era resolution (480i), know what 480i looks like a new TV?

Its location is convenient if you are traveling by car along Highway 401, as it is just to the south of the highway at the Division Street Exit. It isn't quite so convenient if you are in Kingston for something that is happening downtown, however. An Uber ride from the hotel to downtown will cost you between $10 and $15 (CAD). The hotel offers a good hot and cold breakfast buffet, which is included in some room rates. However, since I paid almost $350.00 per night for the stay, the \""free\"" breakfast is a bit of an illusion. They also ding you $5 per night for on-site, unguarded parking.The room itself was spacious , and the bed was particularly good. Pillows marked \""soft\"" and \""firm\"" were a nice touch. The heating\u002FAC unit under the window was a bit noisy. The TV was a disaster. Reception (yes, reception - remember way back when?)  was atrocious - it reminded me of TV's in old roadside motels that have rabbit ears with a ball of tinfoil wedged between them. A remote control with poorly marked buttons and a laminated list of local TV channels were provided for my viewing inconvenience. I tried it for a few minutes and just gave up. Fortunately it wasn't a big consideration. The TV does have an HDMI connector, so I guess you could plug your laptop in and use the TV as a monitor. All told, $350.00 per night is a lot to pay for a Holiday Inn Express out by the highway. Kingston hotels do tend to be expensive in general, but the price of this place, the miserly parking fee, and the antiquated \""entertainment system\""  brings what could be a \""very Good\"" rating down to \""Average\"".",3,negative

The car park is riddled with weeds, and furthermore, you\u2019ll be told on arrival that there are only a handful of parking spaces that are available to you: park in the middle, the front, or the side opposite to the hotel, and you\u2019ll be towed. Park next to the hotel or in the back, or face the consequences. Welcome!\n\nIn all fairness, I stayed here at a time when Princess Street was being overhauled. This made it very difficult to get to the property. A sign near the intersection where Princess Street was closed indicating that the hotel was accessible to guests would have saved me at least 45 minutes of confusion and frustration. I\u2019m sure the construction is a huge inconvenience for the hotel staff and that it impacts revenue, but it\u2019s no excuse for the state of the parking lot or the dust in the EconoLodge hallways. That\u2019s not construction dust. It\u2019s dirt, and it\u2019s been there for a long time.  \n\nThe sign in front of the property asserts that the place has recently been renovated.  This is hard to believe. The lobby is tawdry, the baseboards in the hallways are badly scratched, and the electric blue carpeting is rumpled, posing a tripping hazard. My ground floor room offered a view of a narrow, litter-strewn alley.  Off to the left a large silk houseplant of some kind lay on its side, its faux leaves fluttering in the breeze and catching random bits of paper.\n\nMy hallway was constructed to interfere with a decent night\u2019s sleep as much as possible.  There was a heavy slamming sound each and every time a guest entered their room or passed through the fire door. \n\nAnd then there\u2019s the room itself.\n\nThe circa-1985 patterns and textiles on the carpet, bedspread, bedskirt, curtains, valance, big chair and desk chair had nothing to do with each other. Collectively, they redefined random. The desk chair looked like it had been used as a weapon against creatures that had body armor or some type of exoskeleton, but this had to have been a while ago: the beat-up frame held a seat that was so dusty and stained that I didn\u2019t want to sit in it. \n\nThe carpet was trimmed with six-inch strips of carpeting at the base of the walls, but the strips were loose, and the rusty nails and staples posed a hazard. Don\u2019t stay here if your tetanus shots aren\u2019t up to date. \n\nThe good thing: the WiFi worked great. \n\nThe weird thing: I couldn\u2019t find the toilet paper holder. I sat down in the manner of single travelers everywhere without closing the bathroom door, and then freaked a bit because there didn\u2019t seem to be any TP. Turns out it was behind the bathroom door. A long reach for a 5\u20194\u201D woman, but yes, it was there---and so were the stains on the shower curtain.  The toiletries were of the lowest possible quality, and I did not use them.\n\nUncomfortable as I was, I finally fell asleep around 2 a.m.  My unrequested wake-up call came at 6 a.m., quickly followed by another at 6:05. Disgusted, I got up and got out, the lone guest at breakfast in the lobby. Given the uncleanliness of the property in general, I was none too confident eating there. \n\nKingston is full of great places to stay. For the same or a little more money, you can find lodging where you\u2019ll feel safe and comfortable. Don\u2019t stay at the EconoLodge.

It definetly beats the deal of all the chain hotels in the city I called. So I highly reccommed it.\n\nP.S. This hotel would be even better if it served breakfast. Just my opinion",5,positive

As he mentioned, the location was absolutely beautiful and it was. The place had a cottage-like feel which was really nice especially as the weather is starting to get better. It was a smaller hotel than I had imagined but the room was very clean and cozy. You get a nice view of the lake from the room from your bed. Plus, everything in the room seemed new, including the mattress on which i had a great night's sleep. Coffee in the morning was a great way to start my day back home.

While checking into the hotel we expected an older,typical motel-type place but that was no where close to what this place really was. It was absolutely impressive the moment we checked in. A very nice lady greeted us with a big welcome smile and showed us the jacuuzi suite which was the only room available at the time. She mentioned they are doing some big facelifts to the place and will be adding more amenities this spring. A nice thing to know. \nGlady we picked this room because it was perfect and the price super! Not anything like we had originally expected.

Don't be misled by the photographs on their site as I was. View the room before you accept it. In the summer months, and particularly on weekends, western Kingston's other hotels and motels can often have no vacancies leaving travellers like me without an alternative place to stay. You might be better off initially making your reservation elsewhere. \n\nOn a recent stay, room 105 was in shockingly poor condition, the worst I have ever experienced. The air conditioner was so noisy I could not use it on that hot and humid night. And with open windows you get to enjoy the full effect of CN Rail's musical interludes from across the street throughout the night. Neither the telephone or the cellophane-wrapped bedside table lamp functioned as neither was connected, and I couldn't find anywhere to do so. The disgusting ceiling light fixture, the only working light in the room, was so soiled and full of dead insects it provided no useable light. Fortunately I travel with a flashlight so I could navigate around the room. Unfortunately, its bright beam startled the colony of silverfish who had set up housekeeping in the room. Sorry guys. (Don't put anything on the floor here that you plan to take home.) \n\nThere was also the heavy odour of smoke in this designated non-smoking room, so I saw the pilot light on the ancient smoke alarm was unlit and then discovered the alarm did not respond when I pushed the test button. Purely decorative?\n\nThe advertised wi-fi service was not available. \n\nThe tub\u002Fshower's faucet did not allow for any adjustment of water temperature below scalding hot.  Only the water volume could be changed, either on or off. The soil accumulation was worse in the bathroom than the bedroom. If the housekeeper took two minutes to apply a germicidal detergent solution on the tiny room's surfaces many folks would deeply appreciate the effort. Please.\n\nWhen I advised the lady in the office in the morning with these sorry details she claimed regular room inspections were performed. If they do, then this room must have been inspected by someone who has no knowledge of lodging industry standards, - or just doesn't care. A wasted effort anyway. The purpose of a room inspection is to verify it is clean and that everything in the room functions correctly to ensure Bayside Inn's guest's have a comfortable experience and will return. \n\nThis unpleasant experience revealed to me how some greedy people are so ill-suited to provide personal services to other human beings as they care not for anything but their guest's money.",1,negative

We were only staying one night whilst transiting from Toronto to Montreal, thus were not that concerned about the property's appearance. That changed once we got into our \""Suite\""\n\nThere were 4 suites two on the ground floor, and two above. The ground floor suites are dug into the bankside and consist of a reception area with a fridge and cooking area with TV, and a back room which is the bedroom and adjoining shower room.\n\nThe only realistic view was from the reception area. The whole place was filthy! I'm very careful to use that term, as I'd not wish the owners any bad review, but it did not look like it had been cleaned in weeks. Some of the  photographs will show the detail of what I mean.\n\nThe bedroom was similarly unclean, and had only a small basement style window which was covered with an old curtain. It would have only looked out at the stairs in any case.\n\nThe shower room was disgusting, and I was not clear if washing hear would actual;;y lead to us being any cleaner when we left.\n\nAs we'd travelled several hundred miles, and did not have an option we decided to tough it out for the night.\n\nWe found a restaurant about a mile down the road, but otherwise the area appeared to be residential only. I did not want to drive all the way into Kingston just for a meal.\n\nWe did sit on the plastic chairs by the lake in the evening after dark, and to be honest this was quite relaxing. Not much hassle from the airborne bugs, but that could be a time of year thing. We took blankest from the room but only so we would not get dirty off the plastic chairs provided.\n\nDuring this period it became apparent that the other major issue was the trains. Every 10 to 15 minutes a train would pass. The train to track noise was bearable, but as a crossing was nearby they ALL blew their horns to warn other users of their approach.

Stayed for three nights, while visiting friends in Kingston and Bath. Good location... right in the middle.\nThe good stuff: staff, breakfast, parking, wifi, view of Collins Bay(not from most rooms but from property and breakfast knook) and rates. We had a small suite for $120\u002Fnight, includes breakfast) in the main bldg, near the road. On one day the breakfast attendant actually cooked us poached eggs because it was not in the buffet. Regular buffet has the usual hot items: sausage,  turkey bacon, scrambled eggs, croissants, cereal, yoghourt, much fresh fruit, coffee, tea and more.\nVery nice restaurant\u002Fpub just about 100metres west at Collins Bay Rd. Tim Horton's across the street along with a gas station. Very safe area for walking and close to everything in Kingston area. About 7-10 minutes from downtown.\n\nNow, the not so good. This motel is about 100 metres from the main railway line (double tracked) between Toronto and Montreal. Consequently, trains travel by all day and night. To complicate matters, Collins Bay Rd crosses the tracks about 150 metres away and, by law, trains must blow their horn.... it will startle you initially, if outside. Thereafter it is just an annoyance and if you are a light sleeper it will wake you several times in the night. Keep the windows closed,,, it helps and\u002F or wear earplugs. It can be noisy but not as bad as Flagstaff AZ. Ask for a room in the motel section, nearer the water; it may be better.\nOne more negative item; A Queen suite (at least our small one) does not have a queen bed, rather a double bed with one small single bed (both not the most comfortable). This is misleading and should be addressed by management. It did have stove, small fridge, microwave and a coffee machine. Bath room was newly renovated but shower pressure was light and may not be OK for some. It did have a hand wand shower head that will be appreciated when showering special parts of your body. Not exactly euro-luxury but unexpected in most econo-motels. Note: the beds covered up wall electrical outlets making it tough to charge multiple devices.\n\nNo pool or hot-tub and I do NOT suggest taking a dip in Collins Bay\n\nOverall, this is OK value if you can stand the trains.

Ohhh ok, and that as a local she doesn't even hear them anymore, that's wonderful for the locals, but as a visitor, I'll tell you I for sure heard them and knew I would be awoken every time they went past, I told her my concern and if we could be moved somewhere more quiet.\nShe stated that the hotel wS booked (only 22 rooms) so I understood that, if there was not something away from the road, we would have to go elsewhere, she was very sympathetic and after just a few mins. Had found a room away from the main road. Room 109, a king sized bed and it was very clean,compared to the Motel6 we had just come from (read that review I have posted) this place was a FIND. Great actually. Thanks so much annabell.\nThe free breakfast was delious, fresh scrambled eggs, hash browns, bacon, and crosants that just melt in your mouth, and everything in between.\nIt was a gem,and would have no problem with a recommendation, crept, not on the end room. Near the road.\nFriendly staff and nice clean comfortable room.\nThanks for reading",5,positive

As they point out on their lobby sign, they\u2019re $20-100 cheaper than the ones downtown. Still, they\u2019re also a good $20 more than the similar Motel 6 on the other side of Toronto and about the same as the M6 in Hollywood. \n   The room was exceedingly spartan but very clean. The d\u00E9cor looks like an Ikea kids room but the bed was comfy, if firm. It reminds me as well of 60s sci-fi movie sets or the early McDonald\u2019s furniture, which was designed to make people leave quicker, and which is just what I did in the morning. The TV unit was not working well and the AC and fridge were also of the cheap and noisy variety, so I turned them off.\n  The lobby has self-serve vending machines which accept bills, so that\u2019s useful too, as there\u2019s not much around and if you arrive late and hungry, as I did, they were needed. There\u2019s a coffee machine in the lobby as well but it\u2019s pretty much the worst coffee you\u2019ve ever had.\n  The hot water lasted about 4 minutes and the room apparently has gyproc walls, so it isn\u2019t quiet and there\u2019s no solace to be found in the shower either.\n   The staff are chatty if not quite friendly. The wifi works OK.\n   Two stars for location and cleanliness, and one for unique, albeit somewhat weird ambience but which may appeal to some as modern. If you want to see something other than a truck depot and gas station, try downtown (and which is a long way from the highway), or stop in Belleville, Trenton or Brockville \u2013 not a lot of choice. I\u2019ve stayed at nicer cottage hotels in Brighton \u2013 and South Dakota for that matter \u2013 and for a lot less. But if you\u2019re on the road and need a pit stop this will work.",3,negative

From one angle, you could swear you were in a hospital room; from another, you can see the attempt to evoke an era, with updates.\n\nThe pictures make the rooms look warm, but the atmosphere is on the chilly side. I had a one-bed room, which made the room very large-seeming and airy. Sounds echo. There were moments when I could hear the people above me as there is no carpeting to muffle their footfalls. The bathroom is so large you can sleep in it. There is no tub, only a shower, and no separation of the shower flooring from the rest of the bathroom, save for angling of the floor to keep the shower water in the shower. \n\nA warm, inviting room? No. Does it do the job? Yes. Once I got used to it all, it was fine. In fact, the bed was THE most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Ever. And I'm serious.

Front desk (particularly Kyle) was great. Any questions I asked or help I needed he was there. Free coffee all day. Check in is fast and easy. \n\nNow for the negatives...\n\nThe lack of carpet in the rooms, while it might make it seem easier to clean poses two issues in this situation. 1. It's not actually cleaner at this location. 2. It causes noise to echo. \n\nSpeaking of noise, you would think being less than 10 years old, they would have access to some sort of quality sound proofing while building this place. That is not the case. Every time a door opened and closed we sounded like someone was walking through our door. To this note, there was a large soccer event in the area which brought a large number of children to the hotel who couldn't decide on a room and were in and out of their doors for hours. LITERALLY.. I spoke with one of the kids at 11 pm after listening to doors open and close for an hour. At about 1210 am I contacted the front desk via phone and was told they would take care of it in a few minutes. At 2:00 am still wide awake due to the noise in the adjacent room and doors STILL opening and closing I went down to the front desk and asked for a solution. He called their room and around 2:45 am it was quiet enough to sleep. Granted a large part of this issue was a parenting problem (who lets their kids do this AND stay up until 230+ in the morning), this problem could have been solved through quality materials used during construction. \n\nThe bed appeared to be of a lower end. It wasn't comfortable at all and the pillows were tiny. \n\nBathroom wasn't the cleanest, but wasn't too bad. Definitely acceptable, but not perfect I'd say. \n\nRemote control was appallingly filthy. Grease or grime of some nature left a coating on it. \n\nFridge's egg holder had some sort of leak at some point drop into it and was never cleaned. \n\nAll in all, won't try to save the extra money next time.",1,negative

We arrived in late, but check in was super efficient and speedy and were in our room in no time.  No complaints here.  \n\nLocation - Prime location for all those looking for easy access on and off the 401.  Kingston Pen is about 10-12 minutes away, give or take, while the downtown waterfront is a little further at about 15-18 minutes.  That aside, the trade is being so close to the highway, so if practicality of entry and exit trumps closeness to attractions, this is your place.  \n\nRooms - Two words:  Spotlessly clean!  In all of my travels and hotel stays, this had to rank as one of the cleanest rooms I've ever stayed in.  The rooms have what I would call an IKEA-esque, European feel to them.  There is definitely more of a leaning towards practicality and efficiency of space which makes it ideal for short stays, though longer stays might be debatable.  Positives include its cleanliness, in room mircrowave, mini fridge, hair dryer, well placed TV, hardwood floors and a comfortable bed.  Negatives include lack of drawers\u002Fspace to store away clothes and no extra toiletries.  Not altogether sure how old the hotel itself is, but everything feels fresh, new and\u002For renovated.  Overall the positives definitely outweigh the negatives.  \n\nValue:  At $100\u002Fnight for a weekend in October, its a definite value keeper when looking for reputable, cheaper accommodations in Kingston.  Comparatively, if you looking to be on the waterfront at say, the Marriott, Holiday Inn or Delta, be prepared to shell out over $200.  Depending what your priorities and trades are, Motel 6 caters more towards those not looking to break the bank and content with a more no frills approach.  In our case, the value was a definite win.       \n\nThe Bottom Line - An experience that turned out to be a very pleasant overnight stay and consistent with the generally positive reviews its receives on Trip Advisor. \nI can see this hotel serving both as a great base for exploring the city without paying city rates, visiting Kingston Pen, or a simple event overnight stay.  One important side note, a typical breakfast is not offered here, not extending beyond a muffin and a coffee, something to keep in mind when looking for morning grub.    Either way, a solid choice and most certainly deserving of its Certificate of Excellence. I would recommend Motel 6 to anyone seeking that combination of value, efficiency and quality.

The rate on Booking.com was reasonable ($80) and traveling at the last minute always pushes prices up and availability down. Anyway, we thought after 400+ positive reviews we'd give it a try. \n\nWell, what a disappointment it was. Motel 6 has tried, somehow to make a motel room even less personable than a motel room can already be. The place is very clean which is a lovely change to most budget places but whomever directed them on their choice of refurbishment and decor has NO idea what a room should feel like. No carpet (which felt really odd), no pictures on the wall, nothing but totally functional pieces of furniture that look like Lego provided creative direction. No closet, you get hangers on a shaped piece of wood on the wall. The TV is enclosed in some weird frame, again modern but lacking any kind of warmth. The bed is so hard I should have just slept on the floor, I probably wouldn't have noticed the difference. Oh, and there is no way they are queen beds. We paid for a Queen but got a double. The staff at the front desk were the only saving grace, she was lovely and provided the 40 plus pillows we requested in order to make our sleeping in that plank bed possible. And what on earth where they thinking when they decided that windows the size of postage stamps was a good idea? Admittedly our view was the highway, but I have no idea what was behind that decision. Natural light is good for you, Vitamin D and all that. \n\nThe walls are thin too. Every time the person down the corridor closed their door, our walls bowed in odd and strange directions. Be prepared for some thudding and noise if you have kids in the room above you.\n\nSo, we'll pay more next time find somewhere that has a little more character and feels a little less like a 1960's sci-fi film set and more like a motel\u002Fhotel room.",1,negative

On certain nights I slept in the cold with the air-conditioner\u002Fheater turned off... \n\nI asked to speak to the manager again during check out, and I was told that he\u002Fshe would get back to me. It has been 1.5 months and I haven't received any call\u002Femail... I had also requested on how the points were calculated or deposited to my account, to which the reply was almost \""please figure it out by yourself online\""... I wanted to call them to ask why I was overcharged for parking fees, when I had clearly indicated that I wouldn't require parking during the weekends, but I just gave up looking back at the extremely poor quality of service from the management.\n\nHaving said the above, I should give credit to the staff at the restaurant, they were very helpful and courteous. But the overall hotel management, and the stay experience - I would not recommended it to anyone. ",1,negative

The rooms are very spacious with lots of room to stretch out and do yoga. The lake view was a real treat. Kitchenette was lovely. No complaints about the bathroom, and the bed was decently firm.\n\nThe big problem with the room was the inadequacy of the soundproofing. I could actually hear people using the washroom in an adjoining room, not to mention lots of other noises. I ended up putting on the HVAC fan at night to drown out the myriad of annoying sounds.\n\nI did have mixed feelings about the television. It was a nice, large TV on a swivel so that it could be watched from anywhere in the room which was great. However it had a horrible selection of analog channels. This wasn't a problem for the most part since I just cast Amazon Prime Video to it, but there was no Golf channel which is really unforgivable during the week leading up to the Masters. \n\nOutside of the room, amenities were decent.

It took front desk staff five minutes to find this information.  We asked if we could pay for a lifeguard to come in and we were told there was nothing they could or would do.  Instead of looking for solutions they wouldn't.  We also kept getting locked out of the pool area.  We had to go back to front desk at least 6 times to get in the pool.

Older (but somewhat renovated) properties will be in the downtown whereas exits next to Highway 401 will tend to feature a few newer, more modern hotels.\n\nWhat I liked:  Simple, effective room layout with sufficient space for a standard family of 3 or 4.  Bathroom was supplied with enough towels for all at check-in.  The bathroom itself is of a good size and well layed out. Shower\u002Fbathtub was large and shower pressure\u002Ftemperature was adequate.  Beds were a bit on the soft side - but nonetheless very comfortable for a good night of sleep.  The main room area had adequate and comfortable workspace, sufficient storage and everything was in working order.  Soundproofing was reasonable.  The main lobby area is nice and with quite a few takeout restaurant nearby (pizza, chicken) it is fairly common for families to use tables and chairs at the bistro to enjoy dinner, rather than eat in their room.  Basic gym with good quality LifeFitness equipment.  Highlight is of course the small, very family friendly pool and the waterslide.  Note that one has to be 4ft tall or more to use the waterslide - which also happens to be the maximum depth of the pool.  Staff were friendly and hotel location is very convenient to 401, shopping (Outlets pretty much on site), restaurants while still being relatively close to the city core.\n\nWhat to watch for\u002Fcould be improved: One thing with Marriott hotels in general is the cleaning products that they use in rooms which leave a very strong smell. This Courtyard was no different.  Also, the AC\u002Fheating unit is one of those noisier, individual, through the wall\u002Fwindow unit which is not as effective for temperature control, then central air type systems. Also, requested feather free room, and room was not prepared as requested (still had feather pillows, and lacked foam pillows).\n\nAll in, for the price, this Courtyard will tend to be a great option for a weekend getaway in Kingston for families.

While the others in the party were not charged for their changes, I was and while it may be my bad for not reading the fine print, I will vote with my wallet and not stay here again. Do not use the prepaid option as savings are minimal and there is no flexibility. I would rate the hotel as expensive for what you receive compared to the other hotels a block or two away.

We arrived early and were told our room was not ready. An annoyance, but not unexpected, after all, check-in was at 3 p.m. However, our room was still not prepared for the allocated time. It seems the hotel was short-staffed due to staff illness. We finally got our room at 3:30. I was annoyed, but the hotel came through for us. We received coupons for complimentary breakfast buffets and a discount at Dox Restaurant. As well, the hotel knocked off the $20 parking fee for the evening. In a perfect world, we would have gotten our room when we arrived. However, we don\u2019t live in an ideal world and Holiday Inn realizes that and compensates its guest accordingly.

Knowing I was an IHG member, I ahold get a \u201Cbetter rate\u201D but I did not get better service.  \n\nDuring my booking I put a note to request room away from elevators, extra pillows and booked a two bed river view. I also made a note that it was my birthday, as other hotels sometimes do a nice gesture for you. \n\nWhen we checked in, the process was very quick and the two front desk clerks were nice, though not overly familiar with the area or restaurants.  We got to our room which was VERY far from elevator (check) and had extra pillows (check), and overlooked the water and pool (check).  Took a quick test on the bed which was very comfy. And that is where my positive reviews end for this hotel.\n\nThe rooms need updating. They are covered in cracks everywhere and bugs.  Yes, the hotel gives you a note to let you know it\u2019s big season but this is just an anomaly of bugs and I was still killing them before bed every night.   \n\nThe Wifi did not even work in the room properly. We mentioned this to the front desk about 5 times.  Twice we were told it\u2019s a new thing happening and they would request a signal boost - which changes nothing. Next we were told as Apple users that\u2019s just the way it is.  We wouldn\u2019t be prompted for the password for a secure wifi connection.  But connecting is the issue.  If you want a good signal strength you have to sit in the bathroom or at the room door, otherwise you (like I had to) consume your personal data. This is overly disappointing and though I do have a larger data plan, makes it difficult to browse the internet comfortably or watch Netflix with the family given one chair and cannot sit around the door all night. \n\nAs we where leaving this morning, my father informed me he had actually privately sent the hotel an email informing them that it was my birthday and if the hotel could make a nice gesture for my birthday.  He even said when we first arrived, the front desk clerks acknowledged his email. And that was the extent of their interaction for my birthday. While I would not have been expecting some $100 bottle of wine or anything but we have been to many hotels when celebrating birthdays and had been given vouchers for a free appetizer and free drink, or a nice plate of snacks and bottle was sent up.

It has possibly the smallest hotel bathrooms I have ever come across.  The light switch for the bathroom is by the door to the room, which is super annoying.  The bed was not comfortable, and although there are two kinds of pillows on each bed (soft and firm) I can honestly say we tested them and could not tell the difference.  The fitness center is located in the same space as the indoor pool, so you get to breathe in a heavy chlorine smell while you workout (awesome)!  Speaking of the pool - it is old, with a peeling finish, a dead millipede in the bottom, and a ring of grime around the tiles that can also be seen around the hot tub.  Nothing a good scrubbing with the right cleanser would not fix, but still...do you need a guest to tell you that?  To be fair, the location is good, with a nice view of the water and close proximity to downtown.  But any joy you might get from that is short lived when you realize they are charging you an extra $22 per night for parking, and the breakfast buffet will run you close to $90 for three people.  Granted it was a good buffet with plenty of choice for even the pickiest of eaters, but a steep price tag for breakfast!!  I would not stay at this hotel again.  For the $$,  there are much nicer hotels in Kingston which are cleaner, larger, and include a continental breakfast.  Not to mention everything is a short drive in this city, so even if you stay just off Hwy 401, it will still only take you 15 minutes to get downtown.  We were there for a dance competition and stayed 2 nights.  My bill with the parking fee added up to $400 (not including the breakfast buffet we ate on Day 1).  A steep price tag for a weekend!! One family we know rented an Air BnB in Kingston, with 2 bedrooms and a kitchen, and paid $75 per night.  So that gives you something for comparison, and I'm sure they had a far bigger bathroom than we did.  The staff did agree to give us a later check-out, which seems to be an inconsistent policy, as other dance competition families were denied a later check-out time (as @Dentyne mentioned).  My advice - stay elsewhere.",2,negative

They was breakfast room service trays still lying in the halls on floor 4 and 5. In the morning there were empty beer cans, bottles and wine bottles littering the room near the pool and in the pool area. Only other issue was the restaurant. The pancakes in buffet were hard and filled with some kind of fruit - no plain on the menu or anywhere which made kids frustrated. The omelettes had pepperoni or some kind of mystery meat in them.

The room was in dire need of maintenance and upgrade while the small bathroom, except for a newish sink, was cheap 1950 style (no marble here !). The bed was the worst we slept in in many years and resulted in a poor sleep and sore back. \nThere were no curtains in the room - just sheers ! Parking at the back was a mud field (the owners are too cheap to have their tiny parking lot surfaced). We had to park 1\u002F2 a mile away.

The front desk staff when we arrived was lovely; when we asked where we could get a coffee near by she made 2 to go for us. We had no issues checking in. The room was fine. I agree with other posters that there is a lot of charm to the property but that there are some aspects that are getting worn (the shabby part of the shabby chic where there was quite a range of furnishings from antique to junk shop it seemed). We stayed in room 307, which was laid out very well. We were happy with to have a mini-fridge in the room also. A bit challenging with the AC as it was in the sitting area and so the cold air couldn't really make its way into the bedroom. It was freezing in the sitting room and bathroom but too warm while sleeping. Not much to be done about that; however, as the windows in the bedroom were *very* old and couldn't hold a widow unit. But if you like to sleep cold this may not be the room for you. Our only real negatives were that the king sheet wasn't fitted to the bed well so all night it pulled from being tucked in and the mattress laid bare. Also the most worrisome was that the front desk staff wasn't there in the morning (the housekeeping staff was very apologetic) and we were actually concerned. We had to leave early (had been told we could have breakfast before) and delayed until we couldn't wait any longer but it meant leaving without breakfast or properly checking out. So we didn't even know what our final bill would be. The lack of staff on the property (at least we assume no staff are there overnight?) may not suit everyone and that, combined with the decor made it feel a little like we were staying in a fancy hostel rather than a $200\u002Fnight hotel.",3,negative

I can only comment on the room we were given, and not on any of the other rooms.\n\nOur room was very basic, with a few items of faded furniture and a radiator which could have started its days in Victorian times. The bathroom was aeroplane size, with only one toiletry (shampoo) and one tiny soap for the use of the two of us. The water pressure in the shower was very low, barely sufficient to call it a shower.\n\nThere was no tea\u002Fcoffee maker or even a kettle in the room, which was a disappointment. No pen\u002Fpaper for making notes. Nit-picking perhaps, but nonetheless important to be aware of.\n\nPrevious reviews have spoken favourably of the breakfast provided. Also the phrase \u201Clight breakfast\u201D has been used without qualifying what this actually means. We were provided with a toasted muffin each, with accompanying jam, peanut butter, a small dollop of Philly cheese and a small packaged piece of cheddar cheese, a glass of orange juice and tea or coffee. Needless to say, lunch came very early on both days.\n\nOne indication that not a lot of money has been spent on the upkeep of the property is the state of the hotel sign on the outside of the building. No more needs to be said.\n\nParking is very limited at the rear of the property.

My lovely room was spacious, clean and nicely furnished with a bed, several chairs, side tables and a small dining table.  There was a fireplace with an ornate iron door and beautiful tile hearth.  The bathroom was tiny but I don't rent hotel rooms to hang out in the bathroom so it worked fine for me.  And there was a wee kitchen with a nicely sized refrigerator and microwave oven.  My room even featured an adorable 'upstairs' closet!  How fun is that!  In the morning, I went downstairs to the parlour where the wonderfully friendly staff brought me a freshly toasted English muffin served with really tasty orange juice on a beautiful antique silver tray.  Coffee and tea are also available and a big bowl of fresh fruit is there for the picking.  All of it was much tastier than the typical hotel breakfast of soggy Danish and soda fountain juices.  As much as I loved this wonderful old boarding house, I had to give the hotel a four star rating.  The door to my room is a great deal smaller than the portal it covers so light from the hallway leaked in all around it during the night.  And the lovely windows were covered with ancient shutters that did not close all the way nor fully cover the windows.  Charming but ineffective in blocking light from outside.  On the other hand, I loved how the sunlight poured in through the gaps and slats in the morning.  Overall, it was quite lovely and I plan to return next time I am in Kingston.",4,positive

I think the breakfast is more than adequate with a variety of juices, milk, coffee, fruit , jams, toast as well as boiled eggs.The motel has converted one of it's guest rooms close to the breakfast area to a small dining area with tables and a tv and it's convenient to eat one's breakfast, read the newspaper, watch the morning news and meet other hotel guests.

I strongly disagree with some of the other comments which appear to be from people who stayed 1 time and got a bad impression.

This was just a quick overnight stop enroute to Toronto, therefore, my expectations were faily basic: a clean room with a comfortable bed. \n\nI arrived past midnight and was checked in by an older couple. I had read previous reviews saying it is a family run business and I could see that. Even though the man and the lady were initially very sweet, they were at times difficult to understand as it was obvious English wasn't their first language. This was perfectly ok, until I had to come back to the desk to request a room change and explain why I was requesting a room change. Disclaimer: I've brought home bedbugs before from a hotel and the first thing I do now when I check in in search around the bed for any sign of bedbug activity. I found what may or may not have been bedbugs. That I'll never know. When I lifted the sheets and checked the seams closest to the headboard, part of it was darkened black. That is usually a sign there were bedbugs there either currenly or at some point. With the flashlight of my phone, I could see there were tiny bugs nesting in the lining. The rest of the mattress looked ok, but I didn't want to take a chance. I went back to the desk to explain this and I think it got lost somewhere in translation... I was offered a room change to a second floor room. I had requested a ground floor room which was initially honoured (fresh off a back injury) but they apparently had no other rooms with 1 bed on the ground floor. The east side of the parking lot was almost empty, so I had a feeling they did have ground floor rooms available regardless. And they did. After much insistence, I was moved to a room with two beds, being told it was usually $10 extra. I understand the usual extra charge, but when a guest just told you he\u002Fshe suspects bedbugs in a room, nevermind it was past midnight (they're going to fill these rooms at that hour???), offering the change should be a no-brainer. Basic hospitality 101. It made them appear incredibly cheap and close to their money.\n\nThe second room had clean mattresses with no signs of bedbugs but the upkeep was poor. Numerous stains (see photos) in various places in what appeared to be a fairly newly-renovated room. Sliding glass door was covered in hand prints. The hairdryer, a wall-mounted type, was somehow hanging out unhooked in the closet and like previous guests, mine was also sticky and rather unclean. Mystery hairs in bathtub. Alarm clock was set for next morning (and properly I assure you, the buzzer light was on on the alarm clock screen) and it never went off. I'm not too sure why so many reviewers found the beds comfortable. It had the same level of comfort as a piece of plywood (granted, it's a matter of personal taste, but I do not have an extremely soft bed at home, but this was uncomfortably firm). Worst beds of any Choice Hotel brand I've stayed at up to now. \n\nI skipped the free breakfast in the morning. I was asked how my stay was and was honest, I appreciated they at least bothered asking. The young man at the desk in the morning was nice. Thankful this was on the cheap side, it's certainly isn't worth anything over $70-80. If you're going to spend more, try one of the other Choice properties in town. The other Comfort Inn in Kingston is owned\u002Fmanaged professionally by a major company and was also recently renovated. It's probably worth the extra $$$.",2,negative

BUT, you will also have to remember to check and make sure that they have given you the NORMAL items usually available in other COMFORT INNS, like SOAP & SHAMPOO ! I have been a member who has enjoyed staying in the COMFORT INNS all across CANADA, EXCEPT for this particular one ! This is TRULY a SAD EXAMPLE of the USUALLY GREAT ROOMS and SERVICE that I have EXPERIENCED at other COMFORT INNS whenever I travel ! MY ADVICE for this particular establishment, is, STEER  CLEAR of this place ! \nThe front desk persons during the day and evening were GREAT, the NIGHT SHIFT\u002FOWNER was NOT !",1,negative

The business is run by terrible people who mistreat their employees in front of their customers. During my stay, I witnessed the who I assume were managers verbally harass and yell at a young woman.

Never in my life would I stay at a place that I know is run by people who mistreat others. \n\nAs for the quality of the hotel: the hallways smell like smoke, the breakfast tastes like flash frozen meals microwaved to \""perfection\"".

It was a last-minute choice (we had to find a place on short notice because the owner of the cottage we thought we had rented double-booked), but we really enjoyed our stay. Our room was charming, the staff were excellent and we enjoyed having the continental breakfast delivered in the morning. The well-kept gardens were lovely and the pool was a real treat after a day of sightseeing, cycling or kayaking. The only downside for us was the fact that the inn is located on a busy road so there was fairly constant traffic noise. We dealt with that by wearing our ever-present ear plugs when sitting outside. All in all, a very pleasant stay.",4,positive

My husband had his 30 year reunion for the MBA program and our daughters wanted to check out the university.  On the Friday night, after we had gone to bed, our neighbours (i.e. about 4 people) beside us arrived back and I don't think they realized that their conversation on the other side of the wall was so loud.  I waited until they were quiet and finally went back to sleep.  I mentioned it to the girl at the reception desk the next morning and she was very concerned.  She said that they have zero tolerance for any noise late at night and said to call a certain number that night if it happened again.  Well, it happened again so I called and woke the poor guy up (I think it was Dan).  He was very nice and I he came right over.  However, 30 minutes later, another room came home and the two guys (their girl friends or wives went inside) stayed outside of their room, having cigarettes.  They were very drunk and were talking so loudly - so inappropriate.  I did not want to call Dan again so after waiting several minutes, I opened my door and loudly said - Please stop talking or I will call the police.  They did go in but after you do that, it's so stressful and it's hard to go back to sleep afterwards!!!!  We really liked the room - it was obviously newly renovated and the staff is great.  I just wouldn't stay here during a Homecoming Weekend again as guests could be very drunk and noisy.  I suppose this is probably a common problem at any motel\u002Fhotel in Kingston on that weekend.

Green Acres Inn fell upon these criteria. We had originally headed to Perth Ontario for an appointment and wanted to stay at the White House Best Western (excellent hotel) however, no vacancies. Long story short, we ended up at Green Acres Inn. It is a somewhat typical motor Inn on princess street in the east end of Kingston, but typical, it is not. The room was more reminiscent of a country Inn. The bath in our room had a corner whirlpool tub and a multi head spa like separate shower. Two flat screen TV's ( one in the bath) and a lovely king sized four poster bed. The room was spotlessly clean and the bed was made with high quality linens and very comfortable. The grounds green and mature and meticulously maintained. The staff were more than accommodating making dinner reservations and arranging transportation for us. And try their (filtered on premise) bottled water, excellent! Continental breakfast was brought to our door precisely at the pre-arranged time and far exceeded my expectations. The croissants were fresh and warm and baked to perfection and the muffins were indeed the best I ever had. Cappuccino and fresh squeezed orange juice topped it off. My only complaint would be the noisy air conditioning. \nDon't get me wrong, Green Acres is not the Ritz but as motels go, it is a cut above! ",5,positive

Although the front desk staff was friendly when we arrived, their tune changed when I went to the front desk to express my concerns about the room.    They didn't even offer to have someone come to the room to check the cleanliness and the broken bathroom door.\n\nOn the Friday night there were a couple of rooms just down from ours that were being very loud and disrespectful to the us and other guests.   We asked them if they could please be a little quieter and take their party into their respective rooms - we were told that they didn't have to as their uncle owned the hotel.   I then went to the front desk and spoke with the manager, who admitted to me that his nephews had rooms there for the weekend and that they could party as much as they wanted to until 11:00 pm, which is when quiet time started.    That was not the case and they continued to party until the wee hours of the morning, preventing us and maybe even others from getting some rest.   When I complained the next morning, the hotel staff said there wasn't anything they could do about it as it was now over and done with.\n\nWe went out for the day to spend time with family in the area and do some shopping, when we returned about 5:00 pm to get ready for dinner, our room had not be cleaned.    I called the front desk and they told me that housekeeping was done for the day as far as room cleaning went unless it was an emergency (ie.  toilet overflowing or something like that).   We found out we would have to wait until the next morning for it to be cleaned.    I then went to the front desk to speak with the manager and received the same response.   They didn't really seem to care.\n\nWe decided to go out for dinner and when we returned around 9:00 pm, we could not find a place to park as the people who were partying the previous night decided to party again, this time inviting others to the party that took up many of the parking spaces, leaving no room for hotel guests.   I, again, went to the front desk and was told that if there were no parking spots left, that I could park at the A&W a couple of doors over and then move my car back when a space became available.    I told them that this was unacceptable as I was a paying guest and had endured about enough.    \""There is nothing I can do\"", said the person at the front desk.\n\nWe returned to our room, gathered our things and called another hotel just down the road.    We told them our situation and all they had left were suites.    They offered to give us a suite for the same price as a standard room considering what we had already been through.   We left immediately and enjoyed our stay at the other hotel.    \n\nI would never recommend the Kozy Inn to friends, family, strangers or my enemies.     Do yourself a favour and stay somewhere else.\n",1,negative

They had come into our room touched our stuff when we weren't there and packed everything and moved us to another room!! I blew a gasket, thought they had lost my glasses, I couldn't find them. When we asked for our money back for that night they refused and said they could not do that.

There's lots of fast food restaurants next door to the hotel (Swish Chalet, Wendy's, KFC, Dairy Queen, Pizza Hut, etc).   Couple gas stations as well.   The rooms are inexpensive (you'll get a discount if you have a CAA\u002FAAA membership, check your company's workperks too for a discount).    The room and washroom were clean.  As folks have been saying the a\u002Fc in the room is loud but for me, it wasn't a big deal.  There's small fridge in the room too.  As of August 15, 2015, the photo on the top of this web page accurately depicts a room.     There was ample free parking as well and the free WiFi was quick.  The evening staff were super friendly.    There was an older gentleman and younger lady working the evening shift.     I had an issue with the WIFI and the young lady resolved the problem in about 10 minutes.  Again, she was super friendly and very professional.  In the morning the trainee person was super friendly too.    The free breakfast was okay.  Its basic, nothing special (i.e. bagels, waffle, scrambled eggs, sausage, coffee, etc.).   \n\nNow the not so nice stuff.  The older lady working in the morning.  I'm not saying she was outrageously rude, but I'm accustomed to eye contact when I speak to folks.  I think its common courtesy to do so.  My interaction went this way during my check-in (its not verbatim, but its pretty close).  Also don't want to sound as if I'm whining.\n\nme - \""Hi\""\nlady - \""Do you have a reservation\""  (then she looked surprised when I spoke in English with a generic Northern Ontario accent- I was born in Canada! ).\nme - \""yes, its under...\""\nlady - \""Do you have credit card\""\nme - \""yes, here it is\""\nlady - \""let me check if your room is ready\""  (she seemed upset that she had to do this\""\nlady - \""Here's your room card, the wifi password.  Move you car to the spot near your room, here are the breakfast cards\""\nme - \""thank you?\""\n\nSo I thought.  Okay, she's having a bad day.  It happens.   Nope, I got the same subtle rudeness when I checked out.   My wife thought the lady was being being discriminatory.  I've been to Kingston a number of times, and the locals are super friendly.  I think the lady working the morning shift needs to reconsider her career in the hotel business.  You need to be friendly!",3,negative

The bathroom was old and therefore dirt still in cracks. I could go on but I believe you are getting the idea. I am forever thankful there were no bugs! The breakfast wasn't too bad, once I mentioned and they took care of the hot water urns were either empty or had cold water. We waited a while for the scrambled eggs but at least they were hot and good. Of the two ladies running the breakfast the younger was exceptionally rude to guests and her attitude was uncalled for as several witnessed. No one at the time we were there was rude, mean or loudspeakers, she was just asked when eggs would be ready, is more coffee coming and hot water. She was very fortunate that Being rude didn't lead to much more. Checking out was another matter unto itself. It was a nightmare of wrong charges waiting for hours. People were irate.

We were originally booked in Room 232 (Two double), then after our first complaint were \u201Cupgraded\u201D to Room 116 (King). We are relatively frequently travellers, and have stayed in all the major chains, including other Comfort Inns. I am sorry to say this was our worst hotel stay yet. While the facilities are obviously dated (no automatic door at the lobby entrance, dingy decor, stale cigarette odors), I would not consider that worthy of a complaint... it is what it is. We booked on Hotwire, and it was listed as a 2.5 star hotel with 90% positive ratings, which I do think is very misleading. For comparison, the beautiful new Holiday Inn up the street is also 2.5 star and according to the booking site has \u003E80% positive reviews. (I find it very unlikely that the positive reviews of this Comfort Inn are accurate, given our experience.)\n\nUpon arrival, we grabbed a complimentary coffee while checking in. The coffee was burnt tasting, stale, and lukewarm. The desk clerk, while polite enough, informed us that a $500 deposit was required since we did not offer a credit card. We are used to putting down cash deposits at other hotels, but the highest deposit we have ever had to put down was $300, and that was for the Embassy in Niagara Falls. This was a bit surprising but still not a deal-breaker.\nWe then went up to our assigned room (directly across from the busy door to the stairs) and were greeted by a filthy room with no linens on the beds, and mattress covers half torn off.  Immediately we went back to inform the front desk, and asked for another room. The clerk promptly found us a king room on the main floor, which was an improvement. The housekeeping still was sub-par, with an unvacuumed carpet, dirty tub, spots on the bathroom mirrors and countertop, and unmopped floor with urine spots and hair. I was bemused to find there was a bottle of water on display with a note \u201CPlease enjoy!\u201D (for $2.99!!!). The coffee available in the room and at breakfast was equally unpalatable. Breakfast itself was passable, although the eggs were rubbery and there was no brown sugar for the oatmeal. I guess I shouldn\u2019t complain about free food. We were able to find three things to be thankful for: 1) the bed was comfortable; 2) the shower itself was lovely; 3) The wifi was adequate for video conferencing. Unfortunately, due to the many other issues noted above, we will not be likely to return or recommend this hotel.

I find this policy offensive and will continue to complain about it and in future look for hotels that do not support the policy.  I have been a Choice Club member for over 30 years and have never damaged a room or taken anything other than a coffee packet, a shampoo bottle or pen.  The problem is that the credit for the deposit is not processed at the same time as the real charge is debited.  The owness is on the customer to monitor and chase after the hotel to make sure the credit is eventually done.  They say 2-3 days but it often takes longer.\n\nAt this property a more serious problem is the spray they use to mask the fact that some clients have smoked in the room.

We were unfortunately not impressed.  1)  The hotel offers parking at a fee which is fine.  The issue is finding out where to park to check in.  There are two small entrances to the hotel on either side of a corner.  No grand entrance by any means.  We had to drive around the block a couple of times to find the where we could park to check in.  I even went on their website while doing this to find out.  Their physical address is on King and there is 2-3 parking spaces (metered) to check in.  If you go around the corner there is another 2-3 that you can use.  We drive a truck and it did fit in the underground parking but it was tight (parking garages aren't made for trucks lol).  2)  Don't expect a grand lobby.  You will find a small desk and reception area.  If you are checking in at the same time as 3-4 other groups it would be packed!  I wasn't even sure if it was the reception desk as it was so small.  3)  The rooms\u002Fhallways are dated.  From the hallway furniture (desks) to the bathrooms, everything is in need of an update.  3) The bathroom was not what I was expecting.  A laminate type counter top, a fan in the ceiling with no switch to turn it on and four soap dishes in the shower.  I even tried the shower gel (after a swim to get rid of the chlorine) and was surprised to find it smelled like men's cologne.  Great for a guy I guess.  4)  The pool looked like it was great for laps!  The hot tub stated that it was for a max of 2 people.  The handrail to get into it was loose, so don't expect it to hold you up if you lose your footing.  There is a large exhaust fan on one of the walls.  Something grabbed my attention when walking by - it was the ton of dust that was trapped in it.  Not sure if it had been cleaned is ages.  5)  When we first went to check into our room at 2:15 we were told that our room wasn't ready yet - check-in isn't until 3 so I understand.  We were allowed to park and came back at 4.  Our room was then ready.  When we got to our room it was quite stuffy so we turn the air on immediately.  The air was on for the duration of our stay and it never got below 21 degrees.  My husband and I both slept poorly due to the temperature.  We usually like it a bit cooler.  When we mentioned this to the front desk we were asked if we had called them to let them know. OF course not.  I'm not going to call at 2am to tell you that my room is hot.  Nothing can be done at that time of night.  6)  We were on the sixth flood in a \""Lakeview\"" room.  I guess technically it can be called lakeview as when you stand on one side of the window and look directly to one side you CAN see the lake.  It's more of a city view (which is nice if that's what you want!).  7)  The hotel did offer free wifi!  8)  When turning on the TV there was an ad for a movie that we would have watch but for some reason it was not available after going through their ON Demand channel.  9)  We had breakfast with our room package.  It was an average breakfast.  Glad it came with our room as I can't pay $15\u002Fperson for bacon and eggs!  10)  We were on the 6th floor.

The tub also had an odd curve at the bottom making it challenging to stand properly but I am broad shouldered. The showerhead also felt low and I'd imagine anyone 6 feet or taller would be uncomfortable. Instead of the usual mini-bottles of toiletries, there are dispensers including shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. This is convenient for guests and great for the environment but it seems like the dispensers can be tampered with.\n\nAs for the rest of the room, it was convenient to have a mini-fridge and microwave. The TV was massive compared to typical hotel rooms. The hotel had convenient amenities including a restaurant, pool, and the gym. In the gym, they had modern equipment including an elliptical, treadmills, and bikes all of which had built-in TVs. There were also free weights, bands, and skipping ropes. \n\nParking in the undeground garage was plentiful for this particular visit in late January, but given that it's a public garage, I can see it getting full in summertime. Watch out for oncoming traffic as the turns are tight. There really should be better signage and mirrors so you can see approaching cars. Also had an issue with the passcard being unreadable about 70% of the time.\n\nOne of the biggest issues in this hotel is the slow elevators. There's only two and they're small.

We had a choice of hotels to stay in, but after doing the research, I made the choice to book the Four Points by Sheraton.  I am so thrilled that I did.  From the moment we arrived, the staff welcomed up with open arms and nothing but friendly faces.  Parking is $18 CAN per day in the lot just downstairs.  There's plenty of parking and the lot is enclosed.  When we arrived, Ron informed me that our room was not yet ready, but took my cell and texted me to let me know when it was.  I requested a high room with a city view.  And that is exactly what we got.  A room on the 8th floor (Room 812).  Nothing fancy, but a large king bed, large bathroom, huge TV, and a gorgeous view of downtown Kingston, including the back end of City Hall right where the farmer's market is on certain days.  Also in view was Leon's Centre, about a 5 minute walk, the Cataraqui River with the Route 2 (Lasalle) causeway in clear view.  The room had a desk and a relaxing chair with ottoman as well.  Fridge was large enough to put food and beverages we purchased along the way.  The bathroom was large, with a huge counter space, large shower \u002F tub and lots of room to move.  Nice hanging closet with plenty of room to put shirts and dresses.  Just a wonderful place to stay.  We didn't take advantage of the health workout room or the pool \u002F hot tub, but plenty of other guests did.  We were in Kingston for 3 nights (July 1-July 4), so being here for Canada Day was a blast.  Walking down to the Harbour just across the street was a pleasure, especially when we needed a jacket or sweatshirt in the evening.  Quick to walk upstairs and get whatever we needed.  The hotel is also close to everything, including many restaurants.  Literally, we could walk to whatever restaurant or caf\u00E9 we desired in 5-7 minutes at most from our hotel.  The only sticking point I would say to inquire about is that the air conditioner worked just fine.  But when it turned on, it was quite loud.  I informed the front desk about this upon check out.  Arda, the front desk staff person upon check out, made note of our concern.  He had indicated that the hotel was in the process of changing all of the A\u002FC units, so some were older models and some were newer.  But this did in no way change the way we felt about staying here.  A fantastic hotel, close to everything, affordable, high quality from check in to check out.  Ron, Doug and Arda were all fantastic, as well as the other front desk staff, whose names I unfortunately don't remember, but they deserve credit as well for being accommodating and wiling to answer any questions at all or provide restaurant recommendations.  I would very highly recommend this property and know that if we return to Kingston in the future, we will be staying at the Four Points by Sheraton.

Unfortunately I don't like honey and my husband doesn't like yogurt. We ate some to be polite and the waitress looked a bit surprised as she took our dishes away. She then brought croissants filled with a small omelette accompanied by a dressing of spinach & tomato. I'd emphasise there was nothing wrong with the food it just wasn't to our taste. I would have preferred to have seen a menu so that I could have declined politely. The other comment is the food is prepared and served beside the reception area and the food smell tended to linger during the day.\nThe Inn was well positioned for the shops, caf\u00E9s, bars and restaurants and the harbour area.

The garden and outside of the building needs some attention but still enjoyable.  The big disappointment was the breakfast.  The \""pastries\"" were not - mostly store bought bagels and muffins.  AND they were wrapped in plastic wrap - looked like yesterday's.  The muffins had been cut in half!  The \""cooked\"" part of the breakfast was strange - tried scrambled eggs one day and they were baked (I think) and greasy.  Next days French Toast was pretty heavy and dry.  No evidence of fruit of any kind on the buffet, cereal was kind of hidden and when I asked for milk for the cereal the waitress asked me \""how much\"".  What??!

data\ca\154992\185226\405211044.html,Hochelaga Inn,"""My wife and I booked our first visit here for the night we had secured Kingston Pen Tour tickets. We needed a place to stay and, in keeping with the historical theme of the old prison, we thought we'd book an equally storied Inn in old Kingston.\n\nTurns out this was the worst Inn we ever stayed at in our 40+ years of traveling.\n\nCheck in.\nWe checked in at 3:30 and we greeted by a young man (University student on a summer job, I presumed). Pleasant enough, he was, but not the Inn owner or professional Inn Keeper one would normally expect in such a place. He mentioned that the Inn was actually offering their very first dinner service on this night. Salmon or pork tenderloin for $34.95 or something. We had pre-made plans so we\u2019d have to pass this time, but thanks for offering. So off we go to our room. \n\nThe \u201CChef\u201D.\nAs we\u2019re heading to our room we walk right by the \u201Ckitchen\u201D area where a \u201Cchef\u201D is getting ready for that 1st dinner. The chatty fellow jumps right in and mentions the dinner and we our pre-made arrangements (but thanks for offering too). During the course of our chit chat, he sarcastically made remarks about our not partaking in his dinner. I suppose he meant it in a funny ha-ha kind of way but after the 3rd time it simply came out in an annoying and embarrassing kind of way. We get it. You\u2019re offering a dinner. Thanks but we already have plans. Sorry we can't be there. Maybe next time. \n\nHe then asked what I might like for breakfast. That implied to me that he\u2019d be there for breakfast and ready to make whatever we want. Great! I was expecting a \u201Cfull breakfast\u201D as stated on the website but this is going be a lot better. I mean, you\u2019ll cook what *I* want as opposed to me eating what *you* feel like making? So I said how about eggs Benedict with smoke salmon. \u201CI\u2019ll see what I can do\u201D said the chef. I\u2018ll be there, said I, thanks. And off we go to our room. \n\nThe room.\nSo we finally get up to the 3rd floor and we\u2019re soaking wet from that day\u2019s  punishing heat and the non-air conditioned (and elevator-less) Inn. I open the door and promptly bang it against some bed-side night stand knocking the $4.99 Wal-Mart alarm clock to the floor. Wow! I can\u2019t even open the door fully without banging into stuff? OK! \u2026 \n\nWe walk in to a very cool and very refreshing space thanks to the 1970\u2019s window AC that comes complete with loud and weird noises. Immediately upon entering you know that you are not in a quaint, romantic, or true-to-its-past room. The \u201Cd\u00E9cor\u201D is beyond boring. It is theme-less and painfully dull. The room just feels like a tired old 60\u2019s motel, really, and the bathroom is this tiny tiny space with one creaky bath tub and with cold water pressure so weak it takes a good ten minutes for the toilet bowl to refill.  Not impressed!\n\nThe Inn.\nThe Inn is indeed a stately old dame. She\u2019s been around and she could still be dazzling and beautiful. Not in her present state, though. This place needs a make-over. New paint, new rugs, new art. It needs themed-rooms with emphasis on Kingston's storied past, or Lake Ontario, or at least the province or the country. What it does not need is a bunch of mediocre black and white reproduction prints of  Paris, India or NYC which can be had at Ikea for a couple of bucks. It needs genuine and real Canadian art and objects that\u2019ll match the city, the area, and the Inn itself. It has SO much potential!\n\nBreakfast.\nSo come morning, we gingerly walk down to breakfast and I\u2019m salivating for my previously mentioned eggs Benny. We get down there and quickly grab a coffee from the coffee table but the cream is curdled. Throw that coffee out and wait for the same young lad receptionist-turned server to bring out a new pint. New pint arrives. Also curdles! OK then. Milk it is.\n\nWe pick a table and the young lad comes to the table announcing that the morning\u2019s made-to-order offering is \u201CFrench Toast\u201D. That\u2019s it. French toast! No eggs, no meats, no cheese, no hash browns, no fruits. Nothing. Just French toast. Seriously? \n\nBut seems to me the chef had other plans for breakfast for us. Where's the chef, said I. He\u2019s not here, said the young man. No chef? Nope. Just French toast. I\u2019ll pass on that, I don\u2019t like French toast said I disappointingly seeing no eggs benny w\u002Fsmoked salmon for this breakfast. My wife said sure to the French toast, being a fan. So I get up to check out what else is at the breakfast table. I saw a stack of multi grain bread next to the toaster and some jam and peanut butter and a bunch of yogurts. That\u2019s it.  One single type of bread! Nothing else. No cheese, no cereals, no fruit. Nothing.\n\nSo I made a piece of toast and grabbed some peanut butter and called that breakfast. My wife then gets her French toast delivered (prepared by another young lad) and promptly pronounces them to be \u201Cthe worst French toast I\u2019ve ever had\u201D. Now. My wife is not fussy and rarely complains but this was so bad she had to say that. These were made from that same (and totally wrong for the occasion) multi-grain bread and seemed to completely lack the obligatory egg bath those require. They were bone dry and utterly bad. She was done breakfast too. \n\nAfter my toast, I noticed on the opposite side of the room (and, oddly, nowhere near the toaster) a plate with English muffins, bagels, and several of those lousy 2-inch so called cinnamon rolls that one can buy at Loblaw\u2019s for $1.99 a dozen. I passed on the ill-positioned lot. \n\nWe were done and walked out wondering what the heck just happened there. That sure was no \u201Cfull breakfast\u201D. Where\u2019s the chef? Is he not here just this particular morning or is he never here mornings? I don\u2019t know. What I do know is that the two young students managing the place that morning, although surely well-intentioned and well-meaning, were way out of their element and completely off the mark. Is there no manager to check and ensure this does not happen? Where is the owner? Why is this whole place managed by 2 part-timers\u002Fstudents? Is there no back up plan if something fails? What is this? A high-end Inn or some dinky road side motel?\n\nSo that\u2019s our one night stay at the Hochela Inn! It cost $217 for this experience. We have paid less for a lot more but have never paid this much for so little. It was a very disappointing experience and we will never be back and it is a shame as this place could be an amazing Inn capable of dazzling any visitor to the wonderful city of Kingston.",1,negative

Breakfast was the worse two pieces of French toast ( nothing else on the plate, no meat, no potatoes etc) that I have ever eaten in an inn or restaurant ever in my 62 years of life!

Whenever I travel, I NEVER give much consideration to any breakfast that's offered. I always make plans to do that someplace else. However, I stayed here for 3 days and had breakfast twice and thought it was outstanding. Even though they offered a set menu so-to-speak, they easily adapted to my low carb diet needs---basically a mini, custom breakfast. They were quite flexible.\n\nI don't know what the story was with the few negative reviews in August, but in mid-September I had a completely different experience. Some people complained about the stairs. Really? Then don't stay there. I'm a physically fit 55-year old and like stairs and walking the 4-5 blocks to stores and restaurants nearby. I loved that convenience plus free parking for my rental vehicle. I only used the rental when I needed to venture outside of the downtown area.\n\nMy room was great. It was at the end of a hall and very quiet--no rooms on either side of me. The air conditioner was a portable connected to the window and was very quiet also. I believe I was right above the checkout desk on the second floor.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't know the name(s) of the owners or managers here, but the slightly older woman with glasses was very helpful with sightseeing ideas and very sweet.

There was only one hot breakfast option, other Inns we've stayed at have offered more options and this would have been appreciated. Also, we were only given one meal, I had requested two as there were two of us, but by the time it arrived and the mistake was discovered, we just wanted to get going as the free parking was ending at 9am and we could not get a spot on site as the parking is limited. It is pretty though and the room was interesting as it had a little sitting area in the tower.",3,negative

Be prepared though - it's a rambly old hotel - creaky stairs, worn carpets. We had a room overlooking the street and the trees. The bed, a king, was very firm - too much so really. The bathroom was adequate, but the surface of the bath\u002Fshower combo was rough and worn - not useable as a bath at all. \nHowever, the staff was very helpful in switching our stay from 4 days to 3 - with no penalty - which was apparently in the small print when I booked via Air Canada (which just outsources to Expedia anyway). Side note - that's the last time I ever book on the Air Canada website - they were utterly unhelpful!\nParking is an annoyance - 9 spots, 11 rooms...and all the lanes and roads signposted as permit parking only, or payment via an hourly rate in the city lot behind the hotel. The hotel should absolutely give clients a pass for the lot, or have room numbered parking. Luckily we were out most of the day, but it would have a bit of a damper, dashing out to pay for parking every few hours!\n\nBottom line: not cheap. You're paying a premium for a historical old city mansion feel - with the to-be-expected negatives. Whether the authentic feel and helpful staff outweigh the negatives - creaky stairs, odd-shaped rooms, somewhat tired bathrooms - is a personal preference.

Each day around 4pm, Kathy sets up homemade treats in the livingroom with fresh coffee, tea and an interesting cold drink (lemon\u002Fcranberry when we were there) - which was very refreshing! She also had lovely nanaimo bars as a treat. This is not very common with most B&B's, so we were quite delighted by this nice added touch. \n\nOur room was gorgeous.(the Victoria Rose suite). Huge, very comfortable bed with soft, silky linens. Even the towels in the bathroom were folded in a creative way - and were thick and soft. Loved the marble floors in the bathroom. \n\nAt night, we turned on the electric \""fireplace\"" which gave a lovely glow to the room. \n\nThe house is very quiet, and my husband and I both had very restful sleeps in the huge four-poster antique bed. The suite was quite large with a few comfy chairs as well. Breakfast --- very creative way to serve peach \""muffin\"" pancakes that were really yummy, along with fresh fruit cocktail. Kathy was aware of our food preference and even substituted the pork sausages for us with lovely cheese. Some places we have been to don't bother - and even go ahead and put the bacon right on our plates. Kathy went beyond to accommodate us! \n\nNow -- her gardens. WOW! I sat out by the koi pond with a morning coffee, and could have stayed there all day!

On an evening in summer I found sitting on the porch with pals a fine way to end a long day of sailing or ambling \n\nThe house itself begs to be explored but the rooms we can enter are just lovely. Well kept, period furniture and decor and immaculate. There is a reading room with a piano but I didn't ask if you could play it or it was for the landlady. But I think if you're skilled then a wee tinkle on the ivories is a must. \n\nBreakfast is given in blocks of 8-9 9-10 if my memory serves and fo the outset you know you're going to be very well fed. Coffee is well made and fruit juice is fresh. All the breakfast was home made and lovingly so. I actually cannot quite describe what I had but I can tell you I still wake up nights dreaming I'm eating it again. Yummy. \n\nGetting into town is a 10 minute walk or less so this place is perfect for that. There's also a very pretty park near by to take a good wander in to work off that breakfast\n\nThe room was on the top floor, private bathroom for me is a must and you must check when you book that your room has this as I think one or two are shared. Not an issue for some but I like my own bathroom. Shower was powerful and good toiletries if you're traveling light. \n\nThe bed was just wonderful. Firm with exquisite period framing.

She said she would have to \u201Creboot\u201D it which would take a while. \nCame back to the room that evening and there was a note from Kathy saying there was nothing she could do till Monday. \nThe next morning she asked us where we went for dinner. We replied Jack Asters as it was the only place we could get a table that night. I mentioned that my husband was disappointed the tv wasn\u2019t working as he liked to watch sports in bed.

The Rosemount bedroom lives up to its description and breakfast was delicious where we met new friends at the communal table.  Spa was also available, though we didn't have time.  One note - the spa is aromatherapy-based so does not have an RMT for those who are looking to have it covered by a work benefits plan.  Also, while not an issue for us, visitors should note that most stores are closed for shopping in downtown Kingston on Sundays.

It was originally recommended to me for a work trip, and I was anxious about what the B&B would be like, and whether the Inn Keeper would be  friendly etc.  I have not looked elsewhere since. Holly and her team are friendly without being over the top, and are always welcoming. The decor is in keeping with the house, which although is old fashioned by most tastes, works in this context. The facilities are clean and modern and the breakfasts are really good (bring an appetite). The spa treatments are excellent, and you do not feel self conscious or like you are being rushed through to get onto the next appointment. And Holly is always looking for ways to improve things further, and is quick to pick up on suggestions or even pick up ideas from random conversations about other spas or inns. Nothing is too much trouble. I always feel very at home there, helped by the presence of Katie, the Golden Retriever. One time I was unlucky enough to become very ill while I was there, and they were so kind to me. Holly always does everything she can to help you make the most of your trip - you just have to ask.  I have to say I was very surprised by some of the negative reviews on this site - I cannot say that they are representative of my many experiences of staying there or of the other people that I have met at breakfast during those trips.

How to rate a place that has the unique features expected of all B&B's? First, I was the ONLY guest in a house that has 11 rooms. Yikes! I did appreciate they opened a day early to accommodate me but they were not quite prepared. The manager was onsite but it was still rather strange. I stayed in Jenny's room, a simply decorated room featuring soothing blues, a gas fireplace, comfortable bed and a nice view. The ''antique' furniture needs replacing, loose legs on one table, drawers difficult to open in a dresser and not quite the right period. The Chinese blue and white porcelain lamp bases and painting were very nice touches. Unfortunately seeing shampoo on the Shower floor was not a pleasant sight, nor did I like the far too often used, tacky dispensers. They drip, fall out of their holder and had not been topped off nor properly cleaned. Rust coloured gunk came out of the shower gel dispenser. Towels were not folded the next morning until after I requested it, reusing is fine, but please do the whole room at the same time. I was told the cleaner had not wanted to disturb anyone - I was not in the room but my daughter and SIL had gone up to see it. Just knock!\nBreakfast both mornings was wonderful. Gary is a great host. Coffee was very nice. Service quiet, (well, I was the only one after all) polite, meal explained without glorification - Gary leaves his food to speak for his skills. I sat at the dining room window, a cardinal visited the second morning. The charm from coffee in the sitting room to being invited to the dining room is an old fashioned treat.\nTherein lies the problem, the room discomforts - sporadic service, cheap soap\u002Fshower goods and not an easy shower to control - were outweighed by the overall comfort of the room, the house and the breakfast. Would I return? Probably. So, rather than 3 stars I gave 4. I am hoping a return visit will mean some improvements although I do know no chance of changing the soap management. I will have to bring my own - which does not make me happy as I like to travel light.",4,positive

I have never written a review for a hotel within Ontario, my home province, but this inn warranted writing a review about it.  I have a daughter at Queen's U, so in the last 3 years, I have stayed just about everywhere, but I have never had a good night's sleep anywhere in Kingston.  I've been smaller hotels, like the PeachTree (reasonable but hard beds and noise) to chain hotels like the Radisson (nice rooms, but I got no sleep in the new sleep number beds), so I had little reason to believe I would actually get a night's sleep based on previous 12 visits all over Kingston.  This was lucky 13 for me.  I slept comfortably and deeply and felt great the next day.  The beds are wonderful with deep comforters and plenty of pillows so one or two will be just exactly right.  The bath towels are oh so fluffy, and plenty of them and the complimentary shampoo and conditioner were first rate.\nThe innkeeper is a great amature psychologist who helped negotiate a tricky situation for me and my visiting daughters when things went not so well between them.  An evening that could have seen ruined was completely turned around with her assistance to a wonderful time for all.  I am very appreciative for that.\nThe next morning, we were greeted with a superb breakfast that I never expected.  I am use to maybe some tea\u002Fcoffee and go over there to make your own toast, but this was incredible!!  A hot sit down breakfast and fantastically tasty.  Yes, guests do sit down at the one very large table for breakfast, but is it really such a hardship to enjoy a delicious meal with a few other guests? If you need a particular sitting time, just email that in advance. There is a small separate table that looks like it can be requested.\nAs to the Golden Retriever who does indeed live there; there is no dog present at the breakfast table, that is a myth, however she does live at the inn. She give the inn a warm and comforting feel to it and I think she's a great asset.\nI shared a room with my two teenage daughters and there was plenty of space.  I could get up early and use the spacious front parlor to catch up on my diploma work while my daughter slept upstairs.  It was a perfect set up and felt like being at home.  I can't say I felt that relaxed during any of my other stayings overnight in Kingston.\nThat would be the bottom line of why I will definitely book again at the Rosemount.  I pay to be able to get a good night's sleep and to not feel stressed about having to be away from my real home for a night.  This inn provides exactly what frequent travellers want and need.  If other reviews wish to get hung up on their perception of imperfect period decor or other side points, it is their priviledge.

Holly's knowledge of things to do in Kingston makes the stay in this beautiful city (and the original capital of Canada) much more enjoyable.\n\nWe are planning to go back again next year.  Whoever said it was bad obviously has no taste.  It is absolutely wonderful from the comfortable rooms to the common areas where one can relax with coffee in the morning while reading the supplied newspapers and have tea and cookies in the afternoon with Holly and other guests.  A lovely porch safe from the elements and a beautiful garden to walk around and relax in.\n\nKeep it up Holly - it is a great place to stay.  Thankyou.\n\nJanet, Jane and Lize\n",4,positive

The home dates back to the 1850's and the Innkeeper Holly has done an impeccable job of maintaining this beautiful old home. It was absolutely charming. We stayed in the Coach house, which was perfect for 3 of us. We had our own living room - just what we needed for relaxing and watching an old movie together.\nThe 2 breakfasts we had were absolutely delicious. What we all loved was that it was very relaxed. We dined with other guests at our large table (always nice to be seated with people you have never met) We also loved was that the chef came out both mornings to tell us about what we were eating. A beautiful, fluffy, crust-less quiche with baked scones on our first morning and unbelievable french toast with a berry pomegraniae compote the second morning. I like great food and this was truly outstanding both in flavour and quality of ingredients. In the afternoon, we were offered tea and cookies. They make the best Christmas fruit cake I have ever had. The marzipan icing was really good. My only regret was that she was not able to sell me some. But if she ever does, I would be very happy to drive 2 1\u002F2 hrs again to get some.\nThe Inn was very clean too. Holly truly takes pride in her place and it shows.\nIf you want to go to Kingston, this is the place to stay. It is a short walk to all the shops downtown.

The two guys at the front desk told me that a company has a contract with the TV box to not allow anyone to watch anything other than their content. They also went on to say that all hotels operate the same way. This is a complete lie as I stay in hotels all the time and never have this issue. If they were upfront about all their policies and practices, I would not have chosen this hotel. If I could give 0 stars I would.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: Stayed in this hotel on a conference. For starters, this hotel is in a great location. Right along the harbor.\n\nOne thing you will notice is that the exterior is kind of out dated and is NOT wheelchair accessible. The guy who checked us in was friendly and professional. However, there was a female staff member \""chillin\"" behind the desk with her earphones in and was clearly on break. Just looked a little unprofessional.\n\nThe outdated exterior carries on into the hallways. Out dated but very clean. Our harbor front room on the 6th floor had a great view. Larger than the \""hotel norm\"" mini-fridge. Large LCD TV and plenty of cable channels. Beds are very comfortable.\n\nFor me, my experience sort of fell apart in the morning. Breakfast is served between 7-10am which is an hour later than I am used to. This forces me to break my routine and end up rushing to get ready for my day. They also have a policy that you cannot get breakfast and bring it to your room which seems very counter accommodating for the guests. Also, to be forced to wait until 7 (the staff actually forgot to open the breakfast room until 7:15) for a cold breakfast consisting of cereal, cold hard-boiled eggs, and yogurt seems ridiculous. Your warm options are restricted to toast, and croissants. The guy looking after the breakfast room seemed to either not be a people person, not a morning person, or both. \n\nThe pool is outdoors thus is seasonal. Pretty small and kidney shaped but is right along the harbor and would be nice in the summer. \n\nThere is a lack of soap and shampoo in the room plus one toilet paper roll was gone (there are 2 holders) and the second was half gone without any new rolls anywhere. The facial tissue was gone as well. Very few towels and face cloths.\n\nOn the plus side, there is an iron and full-sized ironing board in the room as well as a blow dryer, coffee maker, and desk.\n\nOther reviewers are stating that the price is good. I stay in a fair amount of hotels and find that the conveniences and amenities are far lower than lower priced hotels. The cost was approximately I paid was $300 for 2 nights. I have not checked out yet but that is what they pre-authorized my credit card for and the guy who checked us in said that was the amount for both nights.\n\nI would not stay here again just because I know what is out there for the price and this place is not even in the same category as some motels.",1,negative

We booked this hotel and saw the good reviews and the location was in perfect walking distance from my moms conference so we thought it would be perfect. Little did we know it was like we jumped back into the 50\u2019s with this outdates place. \nUpon arrival there is NO parking. The hotel does have a little underground parking but good luck finding a spot. Oh- and dont bother looking outside. Even worse to find parking.\nWe go inside to check in and we are greeted by 2 young ladies behind the counter. One was really nice and helpful and pleasant to deal with and she was helpful giving us directions to restaurants and places to go. The other one had a bit of a chip on her shoulder and had that awkward tweeny personality and made everything awkward by just the way she spoke. \nWe finally get to our room. This place like i said before is so outdated its unbelievable. To the point that its ugly.  The light in the room are all lamps and the bulbs would flicker from time to time and it kind of gave it that haunted feeling. Creepy. The carpets are so old and ugly that it kinda makes u feel like they are dirty. I cant actually say if they were or not as part of me would rather not know and i wore black socks the entire time. The entire building including our room had this aweful smell to it. I cant explain it. This may sound silly but it smelt old. It was an annoying smell that never went away. The room is nice and spacious i have to admit. \n\nThe bathroom seemed clean but there was no fan in the washroom so if someone did a number 2, you pretty much get to go to sleep with that smell on top of the old stingy smell the building comes with. The tub had this ring around it that i didnt want to find out if it was dried up soap or dirt or i dont know. All of us decided to just not take a bath\u002Fshower just in case. It could just be the shine that was wearing off the bottom of the tub but again i didnt want to find out and if it was then again it makes another point to how outdated this hotel is. \nThe tv is outdated as well. The remote in our room gave us issues and the subtitles wouldnt go away after we even turned them off... thankfully i just watched my ipad.... oh wait no i didnt- the wifi IS TERRIBLE. It comes and goes as it pleases. It stops working randomly and then works again all of a sudden. And then stops. \nThe beds were okay, i mean they were a little harder then i typicaly like it but sleepable. The bed sheet that s SUPPOSE to have an elastic in it and hug the mattress is non-existent. Its a regular sheet that is just over the mattress and tucked under it. The pillows on the other hand ARE ROCK HARD! They are bend-your-neck-to-the-point-you-get-a-kink hard as a rock. And they are extra poofy so your neck really bends to get on it. Bring your own pillow. Trust me. \nBreakfast? Dont waste your time. Go down the street Tims and grab a coffee and breakfast from there. All the hotel offers is toast\u002Fbagles with peanut butter and jelly and honey and butter. They have boiled eggs, sliced oranges, rock hard muffins, and cereal. Not a breakfast of champs by any means. Its even poorly displayed to the point you dont even want it.\nAll in all, avoid this place.

One of the \""Managers\"" I believe his name was Scott, told us that next time we should go to Holiday Inn. Some of the parents had to move to 2-3 rooms till they got a clean and smell free room. Cleaning staff were very aggressive in the morning to rush us out the door before check out time. In the Morning they were also very loud in the hallways and using profanity around our kids. \nWe will definitely consider Scott's the \""Manager\"" suggestion and choose a better hotel next time we are in town.",1,negative

All was not horrible -- the staff were really nice and friendly (especially the breakfast staff), the bed was comfortable and the views are splendid.  \n\nNow for the bad:  the parking garage is a disaster. If you drive a large SUV, forget it.  You can't even drive into the larger lot if you have a roof rack as you won't fit. I found out the hard way -- by hitting it on the way in. I was exhausted after hours of driving and did not notice the bar above me. The attendant came to find me as I was trying to park, and indicated that he missed me coming in or would have stopped me. Of course, I had to hit the same bar on my way out, and luckily caused no damage to my rack.  I had to park in the front area of the lot, which does not accommodate many vehicles.  As a result, I avoided driving anywhere during the weekend, so as not to lose my good parking spot.  \n\nThe room was okay, but needs an update.  The bathroom really shows wear and tear, especially in the shower where the tiles look pretty terrible.  Our coffee machine died after making one cup of coffee.  I didn't bother calling the front desk because when I called earlier to ask about bottled water availability I got a vague and unhelpful answer and had to play twenty questions with somebody to learn, eventually, that there was a vending machine on each floor that sold water. \n\nThe biggest complaint I have is the noise level.  I don't think these rooms have any soundproofing at all.  We had an unfortunate location, right next to the elevators.  We could hear every word of every person waiting for it, and they weren't even being too loud.  The hockey team that stayed on our floor (darling young boys, really), DID make a lot of noise as they cavorted around the hallways on their way in and out.  Why a hotel mixes other guests with hockey team families is beyond me, as it seems a recipe for disaster.  Having had young children myself, I was determined to be patient about this noise, because nobody can expect little boys to be quiet and overall they were pretty good.  They were young enough that their noise stopped before we went to sleep. \n\nI feel that this hotel is far more expensive than it should be.  I travel quite a bit, and have paid less for much nicer properties with nicer rooms, better amenities, and no charge for a \""marketing fee\"" (how ridiculous! Why charge a client for this? )  \n\nOh, and if you decide to respond here (I am not expecting such), don't bother mentioning that I \""could have called\"" to complain about things and you \""would have done\"" something.  The hotel was completely full, it was clear, and I was but another body in your rooms.\n  \nThis body will not return.  You get the two stars for a view that you did not create and staff who are pleasant and ought not to suffer for the inadequacies. To charge so much for accommodations that in my view barely reach a three star level is really unconscionable. I will likely avoid the Marriott chain in the future, as I have no confidence in them now.",2,negative

The Delta hotel is really the best choice to explore and enjoy Kingston.\n\nIt is located ideally right over the water and we had a wonderful view of the harbour from our room.  The room itself was very spacious, very clean and all the amenities (t.v., internet etc) worked well.  The bathroom was also very clean  - housekeeping was fantastic.\nCheck in went smoothly and we found all the staff to be helpful and friendly.  The restaurant on site is nice - we only used it for breakfast however - the waiters very good - but the food was expensive.  Since there are dozens of great restaurants within walking distance of the hotel, I'd recommend (weather permitting) that guests check them out too.  We had many great meals!\n\nA few snafus kept this from being a five star experience.  The first (sleepless) night, we were awakened repeatedly by the loud cycling on\u002Foff of the AC unit.  (Avoid room 427).  We had asked that a maintenance man  check it before we went to sleep and the staff sent someone up right away.  His advice was that nothing could be done.  However after a dreadful night, we needed to move rooms and again the staff was very accommodating in finding a better option and we moved down one floor to room 327.  That room had a different and more modern AC unit (my husband is familiar with these units) and although it did cycle, it was much much quieter (barely perceptible).   The hotel acknowledged the trouble this caused by telling us that they were 'very sorry' but perhaps a complimentary breakfast would have been a more generous gesture, given the lost night and inconvenience of packing up and moving rooms. \nOne other issue:  We never ordered room service but many on our floor did.  Unfortunately the dirty food trays were left out in the hallway for over 24 hours - moldering in the heat - and believe me, they were not appetizing - in fact a real turn off by day two!\n  \nOther than those two unfortunate experiences, we would still readily return to the Delta if we visit Kingston again.  The pluses far outweigh the negatives and I would highly recommend the hotel.  If the management ever does read reviews and contemplates any changes for the better, I'd recommend:\na) Getting rid of all old and noisy AC units - sleep quality is REALLY important on a vacation.\nb) Make sure dirty dishes in the hallways are quickly retrieved.   \nThank you to all who made our stay VERY enjoyable.

data\ca\154992\188289\699420326.html,Delta Hotels by Marriott Kingston Waterfront,"""We came from Toronto Delta so our experience at Marriott's Kingston Delta Waterfront was  a bit of a letdown. Check in took far too long with someone who had no name tag on and wasn't very effusive. Necessary drive up the car park exit is understandable given the unfortunate situation with neighboring building. Room was clean & comfy but as BONvOY Titanium Elite members we not only were not greeted warmly & received no upgrades but we didn't even get our room preference location of high floor. Breakfast in the Aquaterra restaurant was strange. Service was fairly attentive BUT we were told it was suggested to make reservations as it gets very busy even for early risers. We never saw more than 8 people in the restaurant for our 6:30AM breakfasts. They offer no buffet and have no lounge AND they place a limit on what you can order with voucher provided to Titanium Elite members; $33.96 or some odd number like that. Cannot substitute Oatmeal for cereal on Continental Plate because \""it is offered as a separate item on the menu\"" but so is everything else on the Continental Plate. Coffee is only included in the price of 3 breakfast options and each day we went over our allotted amount by $3.00 despite not being big eaters. The food itself was good though a bit pricey.\nDespite needing to walk in & out past the Front Desk, staff there rarely look up to greet those walking by. Yes, the hotel appears a bit dated, low ceiling, darker colors but it appeared clean. We had no issues with noise as cited by other reviewers. As stated at the outset, our review of this particular Delta may be skewed by the totally customer service experience we had at the Toronto Delta the few days before arrival here. On the plus side, the hotel is located on the water in center of town with easy access to lots of shops, historical sites and restaurants, bakeries, etc.",3,negative

A few things could have been done to help mitigate these issues.    Incorrect hotel signage on Ontario Street (and the outside of the hotel) could have been temporarily changed or covered until construction is complete.   An email could have been sent to upcoming guests to give proper directions.  Some other issues are harder to fix.   The entrance to the lobby inside a dirty (and busy) car park is very bizarre.  No dedicated pedestrian lane to navigate the car park ramp was unsafe. \n\nOnce in the hotel, the room was nice, bed was good.   View excellent.   However, little things like only one bar of soap and one coffee packet in a double room didn't seem to make sense.   The housekeeping staff was very good though and took care of that right away.

Downtown is about a 10 minute drive and as far as parking goes, I would suggest the parking garage at the corner of Brock and Wellington Streets. Here the cost of parking is as cheap as anywhere in the city. The first hour is free and each additional hour is one dollar. One word of caution though, be sure you have  $2 and $1 Canadian coins available because if an attendant is not there to collect the money owed, you must insert the coins at the egress gate to be allowed out of the garage. We were there just shy of 6 hours and the attendant had gone for the night so we paid only the $3. This means that if you take one of the boat tours in the area, you can easily park and walk the two blocks to the boats. If you stay in the area is a short one, then plenty of pay to park meters are everywhere. Back to the motel. If you stay intown Kingston, you might pay as much as $250. If you want to be within 10 minutes by car, and not mortgage your home,  I would recommend trying this motel. There really is nothing objectionable about it.",4,positive

When I talked to \""Mustaffa\"", the owner, he definitely played up his establishment.  We originally planned to stay at the Brown's Bay Inn (an excellent choice), and decided to try The General Wolfe based on \""Mustaffa's\"" glowing review of his place.  If you read the other reviews on this hotel\u002Fdump, I have to agree.  The registration desk is in a smokey bar, where you have to try to find someone to serve you...and hopefully they aren't drunk!  The people in the bar are definitely the \""dreggs\"" of Wolfe Island.  The room..pathetic.  Really tacky decore, down a dark hallway.  My wife refused to stay.  I agree with the other review, I was worried about my car being stolen from the parking lot.  I called the Wolfe Island Tourism Office and suggested they remove him from their web site as this is really not a hotel they would want to represent Wolfe Island.   The web site is a blatant misrepresentation.  With regards to the food at the restaurant, I saw the person prepaing the food....hygiene was not high on their list of importance!!

Refused to give us a refund after there was no temperature control in the room. It was freezing. The universal heat control for all 10 rooms was turned on but there is no way to adjust each room. The owner eventually agreed to speak with my husband on the phone (would not come out to meet with him in person) after 3 attempts and hung up on him after he offered up a $40 cancellation fee after being there for less than 1 hour. Owner refused to change the hard and fast no refund policy. She was extremely rude. They turned up the universal heat and it was sub par but only a light blanket on the bed so I was worried we would freeze overnight (I'm also pregnant and we explained that - we were not just being difficult). Asked if there was someone we could call after 9pm if it got too cold. Told no one is really available. \n\nAnyway, the hotel is a dive and while we paid $110 plus tax we felt with the poor condition of the rooms, moldy bathroom (room #1),tired d\u00E9cor and paper this walls (you can hear everything) this MOTEL is worth max 60-70 per night. \n\nThere is zero ambiance in the \""fancy restaurant\"" and bar.

If you can get all that, in a city you love to visit, at an affordable price, in a unique motel that is managed by people who care deeply about the property and every guest, you are very fortunate.  \n\nWe were very fortunate to find ourselves at Seven Oakes Motel, in Kingston, Ontario, after a long, cold day on the road. \n\nOur hosts welcomed us warmly and quickly resolved a problem with our reservation. They are friendly, attentive people who are committed to providing a good experience and good value for their guests. They are excellent motel managers, and they are also similar to some of the B&B proprietors I\u2019ve met in England and Ireland, in that they take a personal approach. Seven Oakes is their home, and the pride they take in it is obvious, much to the benefit of their guests. \n\nWe needed three rooms, and Susie, our proprietress, put us all next to one another. She and her husband made sure the warmest room would go to our 80-years-young mother, who was waiting in the car while we checked in. \n\nSeven Oakes fits the classic definition for a motel\u2014it provides accommodations for traveling motorists. Mom had voiced the hope that we would be able to park right outside our rooms, and that\u2019s exactly what we were able to do. The rooms Susie chose for us were in a wing behind the office, perpendicular to busy Princess Street, so traffic noise was minimal.\n\nOur rooms were exactly what we wanted: clean, simple, with very comfortable beds. By clean I mean immaculate. There was NO dust, dirt, cobwebs or mildew. The beds and linens looked and felt new and fresh. The furniture isn\u2019t new, but it\u2019s clean and in good condition. Carpet and walls were clean and in good shape. My bathroom had the original tile, all in excellent condition. Lighting, sink, tub, shower curtain and toilet were perfectly nice.\n\nWe slept well, because our rooms were warm and quiet. In expensive, luxury hotels there\u2019s almost always noise from elevators, ice machines, banging doors or people who feel entitled to be inconsiderate in the wee hours of the morning. At Seven Oakes, there was none of that. In fact, I slept better than I do at home. \n\nThe Internet access was great. No hoops to jump through or networks to join, it was just there, ready to use. I dealt with email and then did a few copywriting assignments. My clients were very happy that I was able to work for them while out of town. It was wonderful to be in a comfortable, almost retro place and be still be connected to my work. \n\nAnyway, in summary, we love Seven Oakes!

I'm not a fussy traveller and I normally look for affordability, comfort, security, and cleanliness in hotels\u002Fmotels.\n\nPros:\n- Friendly service.  Although the lady at the front counter was somewhat difficult to understand, she and her husband were very friendly.  When I notified them that the wifi was not working in my room, they provided me with an ethernet cable which solved the problem.\n- Spacious room.  The room I stayed in was fairly large.  It had a very comfortable, king-sized bed; a leather couch; a couple of coffee tables; a 32\"" flat screen TV on a TV stand; a dresser; a bedside table; and a mini-fridge.  It also had a \""kitchen\"" sink.  It had a private bathroom, which was a bit small, but I had no problem moving around in it.\n- High speed internet.  I only used it for internet browsing, so it was fast enough for my needs.\n- Location.  I didn't explore Kingston since I wasn't there for sight-seeing.  However, restaurants and other businesses are a short drive away.  There is a Freshco supermarket next door that is open till 10pm on weekdays. \n- Parking.  Plenty of free parking available.\n\nCons:\n- Old.  The motel has clearly been around for a while and appears to simply have been maintained and not improved.  There are signs of wear everywhere you look, from the slightly visible stains in the carpet to the rusting metallic surfaces anywhere you see metal.  The window in the bathroom would not stay up, since the plastic pieces that keep it in place were broken.\nMy room also appeared to be connected to the room next door at some point in its existence.  Instead of walling up the doorway though, they left the door, mounted a wall clothes hanger rack and removed the door handle from the other side.  I could open the door, but on the other side would be the other unit's door without a door handle for me to open it with.  I think as an extra security feature, they had the couch in my room half blocking the door\u002Fclothes rack.  Somewhat creepy.\n- Superficially clean.  Although at first sight it appeared to be clean, after noticing the condition of the room in general, I decided to look closer and I began to see some problems.  Although I never used the air conditioner because it was chilly that day, I noticed the vent had a very thick layer of dust on it and some spider webs.  \nThe towels and linens were white so thankfully you could see that those were clean, but when I looked at the actual pillows they had yellow stains (which I understand are from sweat).  I don't know if they are not washing the pillows or are not using a proper cleaning technique to remove the stains, but needless to say I did not put my head on those pillows.  The bedsheets were covered by a fuzzy, green blanket which had clearly seen a lot of use since small holes were starting to show.  I decided to sleep on top of the comforter, which looked clean on the outside.\nSince the room got a little chilly, I turned up the thermostat.  After a while, I smelled something burning.  At first I thought it was someone cooking something, but my windows were closed.  That's when I realized that the heater was burning dust or whatever was inside it.\n \nNo comment:\n- Amenities.  There were several amenities I did not make use of so I can't comment.  I'm sure for a lot of people this would add value to their stay.  The pool was closed since it was out of season.  There were were two basketball nets and a fenced in tennis court.  I don't watch TV, so I never used it.  I don't know what quality the picture is or how many channels it catches.  But just so you know, all these things are available. \n\nAlthough, this was the cheapest of the higher rated hotels\u002Fmotels in Kingston on this site, I would most likely stay elsewhere if I were to ever spend a night or two in Kingston again.",3,negative

I\u2019ve stayed there three times in the past month, because this beautiful city is a great stopping-off point between my home in Michigan and family-related activities in Vermont. I\u2019ve tried other places, but Seven Oakes is my personal favorite, for a number of reasons:\n1. It\u2019s a blast from the past. Independently owned places like Seven Oakes are becoming few and far between.  I love being able to drive up to my door and unload my car; I sleep better knowing my car is just a few yards away. \n2. I like the other people who are staying here. Last week there was a young family with charming children on one side of us, and a young couple who bravely used the swimming pool (in 60-degree temperatures) on the other. Two doors down an extended French Canadian family sat on the sidewalk outside their rooms, quietly talking and laughing, quite cordial. When we returned from dinner at 8:30 pm, they had all gone inside. The guests I have encountered here seem to be happy, respectful of others, and considerate.\n3. It\u2019s quiet. There\u2019s no elevator noise, none of the slamming of doors and locks that you\u2019d get in a high-rise hotel on the harbor. At Seven Oakes, I\u2019ve never had my sleep disturbed by loud and\u002For inebriated guests just outside my door. The property is on a major highway (Princess Street) but the traffic noise is minimal.\n4. It\u2019s clean. The proprietors care very much about their property and they want each guest to have a good experience here. The furnishings and fittings aren\u2019t fancy, but they\u2019re immaculate. \n5. Great WiFi! After a long day of driving, I need it! And so do my kids. And at Seven Oakes, it\u2019s easily accessible, very dependable, and quite speedy. \n6. It gives me the things I need. Like WiFi, a fridge, a few good cable channels, cleanliness, just the right number of 100% cotton towels, free parking, a decent shower, the security of several locks on the door, peace and quiet, and a friendly staff. I don\u2019t need a clock radio (I have a cell phone), tiny toiletries (I bring the ones that work for me), or printed materials promoting local pizza companies. \n7. The owners are awesome. Stay once, come again, they\u2019ll remember you. They sincerely want you to be happy here, and they work very hard to meet your expectations. They have been especially kind to my 80-something-young mother, who has stayed here twice. My mom, in turn, loves them right back. \n8. You can\u2019t beat the price. I have researched other accommodations in Kingston, and even stayed at a few, but Seven Oakes offers the best value. \n9. Convenient location, part 1. There are pubs, restaurants and fast food nearby. Better still: there\u2019s a FreshCo grocery store right next door. Tired of restaurants and rich food, we went there and bought Fresh Attitude Salads for our dinner, and then congratulated ourselves on having made a healthy and delicious choice. Two salads plus crusty baguette = $9. There\u2019s a Tim Horton\u2019s within easy walking distance for morning cravings.\n10. Convenient location, part 2. Take the Sydenham exit off the 401.

They have good coffee, so that made me happy. The only thing with the weekday breakfast is that it ends at 9:30am.  It is a tad early I find. But that is my only complaint about this place.

I could not resist testing the gooseberry and carrot cake flavours, and they did not disappoint. I could have eaten nothing but their bread and jams all day.

We enjoyed their company at the breakfast table, chatting about everything from the city of Kingston, education, politics, grandchildren, etc.\n\nThe location is away from the city core, so it's not a park your vehicle and walk option. It was a minor inconvenience given all the pleasures we were provided with. Also, the upside is that the nightly rates are significantly lower than the B&B's located right in town.",5,positive

All served on high quality tableware. No need for lunch that day! Bob & Cheryl were extremely friendly and up for a good chat. Bob gave us good info on Kingston and suggested a different route to Toronto via a ferry, a route that passed the \""Lake on the Mountain\"" and many vineyards. Thanks Bob it was just as you said...brilliant!  The B&B is about 8\u002F10 minutes by car to Kingston along the coast road, so in our opinion quite convenient, unless you insist on walking into a city. But we've found on many occasion the city centre B&B's of a poor standard.\nOne thing to note, the custom in Canada is to take your outdoor shoes off when entering a house, which to us is the norm and emphasised Bob & Cheryl's desire to keep the house spotless, no bad thing I would suggest.

First rate customer service!\n\nMy husband was leery of a B&B, thinking we would be staying in a 'guest room' in someone's home...and I can only WISH that some of the guest rooms we've stayed in at family & friend's were so lovely! We had the Oak Room, it had beautiful furnishings and linens (wow, the linens are so luxurious), and our ensuite bathroom had a gorgeous claw-foot bathtub with rainshower shower head. So lovely. It had a blow dryer in the bathroom, so don't waste suitcase space bringing your own.\n\nThere is a little library on the second floor where I left a novel I had just finished, and Nigel told us that if we started reading one of the books and didn't get it quite finished we were welcome to take it with us. Nice. :) We didn't have the opportunity to use the guest lounge on the main floor, but there is a TV, books & magazines, coffee making facilities, and a phone from which Nigel said we could make free North America-wide calls, which we thought was a great touch. There is also a small fridge in the lounge where we placed our perishables. \n\nThe gardens are absolutely gorgeous, a lot of love and care has gone into them. We could have spent much more time in them than our schedule allowed.\n\nBUT...the piece de resistance is the BREAKFASTS. And really, calling them breakfasts doesn't begin to do them justice. Wow!! The first day we had a starter of melons with yogurt, palm sugar and candied ginger and then a main of lemon crepes. Oh my word. So good. And fresh croissants with different preserves (carrot-cake-in-a-jar was my favourite). The second day we had marinated bananas with some sort of fruit concoction on top, and then the best eggs benedict I have had in some years. Perfectly cooked poached eggs, completely delicious hollandaise, they were spectacular. Seriously.\n\nNigel and Tessa are the perfect hosts, welcoming and gracious without being overbearing. They offer advice on things to do in the area if you've never been, and even make dinner reservations. We were there during St Lawrence College graduation ceremonies and they still managed to get us a table at Tango, a fabulous little restaurant we would never have heard about but they recommended. \n\nI booked our stay here because it was rated #1 on TripAdvisor, and the rating is well deserved. They work hard to make sure your stay is nothing short of perfectly memorable. We will be back!",5,positive

data\ca\154992\6536351\342237409.html,Donald Gordon Hotel and Conference Centre,"""Stayed in a Queen room on first floor last night. Let me tell you about the good things; if you are visiting a student at Queens U- it just down the street, it's really clean, if you are attending a conference it has wonderful facilities for meetings,  the complimentary snacks they set out for guests are great; a lovely area for conversation, (dried fruits, candy, drinks,etc.) which makes for a great way to meet others and share some nibbles without having to leave the centre, the place has lots of character, has been updated  and the staff are lovely. Now\u2026why did we not like it? Two things; there are no king beds so if that's what you crave, you'll have to be satisfied with a Queen bed. Secondly, on that Queen bed there is a bed cover which is quite heavy and made of a slippery fabric. There is just a sheet and that bed cover\u2026if you are like me and highly suspect of those hotel blankets, worrying they don't wash them daily and your imagination tells you it should not touch your body\u2026you are out of luck. So you have to use it unless you can sleep with nothing but a sheet on you\u2026and it's heavy and it's slippery so all night long you play a tug of war game trying to get it to stay on the bed. It's more a floor cover than a bed cover. It moved from side to side and from top to bottom all night long! We never slept. It's too heavy; it's too slippery and if they don't wash this monster nightly, your imagination can run wild with what's been happening on that bed cover and how there's nothing separating you from it but a sheet. In some rooms the bathroom fan cannot be turned off so if you can't sleep with that kind of noise, you must ask for the first floor rooms as they don't have that issue. Breakfast is included in the $150 charge and parking is free and those are two big perks however\u2026that blasted bed cover and small bed ruined our night for us so we don't imagine we'd be comfortable going back. If you are a MBA student, we suggest bringing your own duvet\u2026that'd be weird to check in with but at least you'll be warm and rested rather than wrestling with a heavy, shiny, slippery bed blanket. Kudos to the staff for going above and beyond; so wish they'd invest in a few king beds and better bed linens.",3,negative

I surveyed our other family to determine what their views were on the bedding and to a person, we could not figure out why the duvet would be sooooo heavy and awkward.

There are lovely grounds and plenty of free parking.  It seems to be a heritage house which has been added on\u002Fconverted into a hotel\u002Fconference centre.  Check in was pleasant and easy.

The bed was very comfortable and I could smell the bleach on the sheets (not unpleasant).  The hotel offers free WIFI which is a must for me.  My only complaint is that my room had a lovely view of the roof!  I'm sure there are many rooms with amazing views and why they chose to place a first time guest in a room with no view is beyond me. I enquired at the front desk and was advised that the hotel was only 1\u002F3 booked - no excuse for putting me in this room.  If I was staying longer than 1 night, I would have complained.  My overall stay was very nice but it's common business sense to place guests in great rooms particulary when the hotel isn't fully booked.  Not a good first impression on this front.  Breakfast was included in the $99 room fee.  Normally itwould be a buffet breakfast but since the hotel wasn't fully booked, it was an ala carte breakfast for which I would have had to pay $14 for my daughter to join.

The heating\u002Fcooling system has some operational issues as well. In general, the original finishes were very nice but you can tell that they are showing their age so some maintenance and\u002For upgrading is needed to keep the suite within the \""luxury\"" rating. There are no staff on premises so if you have an issue, you need to call and wait for someone to drive out to help you. When staff does arrive, they are super nice and helpful. \n\nOverall, it is nice and it does outshine a lot of accommodations in the Kingston area. Its worth the small drive.

At check-in, we were surprised that we had to initial so many places on the document before adding our signature - I'm not even sure what we were agreeing to. Since my friend had already paid for these rooms over the phone using her credit card, we were again surprised to learn that the hotel required further money from us - a $100 deposit. We were told that we had booked wheelchair accessible rooms when we had not. They could only give us one king room and the other room would be two queen beds. They could not give us rooms side by side but they would be across the hall from one another.\n\nWe had room 135 and it was bug infested. At first, I thought one or two bugs, I could deal with that. We killed a few bugs before we left for dinner and then when we came back and got into bed, there was one crawling on top of the covers, and one was crawling on my neck in bed. I freaked out and told my husband that I couldn't stay in that room. He checked the mattress for bedbugs bur couldn't find evidence of any and told me the bugs we had killed weren't bed bugs (they were larger and brown, and bedbugs are small and black). If we had not come with the other couple, we would have left the hotel that night. However, that wasn't possible since they were already settled in their room and it was 10 p.m., and we didn't want to inconvenience them. My husband took one of the bugs in a coffee cup to show the clerk at the front desk. They suggested the bugs in our room were from having a patio door (which we never opened while we were there). We were given room 257 and packed up our belongings and moved there. I was still feeling unsettled about the whole bug situation and it was hard to feel comfortable in any room at this point. \n\nThe next morning, I asked the clerk if we could get a refund but he explained that the price was blocked out in red on the screen because it was booked through a third party and that he did not have authorization to give a refund any way. He said that you were the only one authorized to give refunds and you did not come in until 8:30 a.m. We were making this request at 6:45 a.m. He refunded the $100 deposit but explained it would show up as $0.01 on my receipt (?????). \n\nWhen my friend went to check out, she could not find anyone to help her at the front desk and we stood there waiting for over five minutes. Finally, I went and looked around and found the clerk in the pool area. We did not stay for breakfast.\n\nWe had stayed in other hotels on our travels to Nova Scotia and back and never encountered any issues. Some of these rooms had exterior doors on them as well. \n\nWhen you have travelled all day in a vehicle, you are tired and just want a comfortable, clean, bug-free accommodation to rest in before getting on the road the next day. Instead, it became a stressful night having to pack up everything and move again.\n\nI suppose my friend will have to go through the third party booking site to request a refund.

Bright, clean, modern like feel with a smiling front desk agent.  Check in was quick and routine and away we went in search of our room.  We were able to park relatively close and that made unpacking a breeze and bringing in our dog simple.  The room was very clean and recently remodelled.  Simple but nice fixtures.  Small bar fridge and microwave under an extended length desk, and nice large easy to see TV.  The bathroom was small but functional.  \nThe pool and pool area were a disappointment.  The pool itself was quite cold, especially for an indoor pool and the hot tub was still out of order.  (Going by previous reviews it's been inoperable for a length of time.) The water was cloudy and I found a few used bandaids shoved up in the corner of the pool area.  The deck area didnt look like it had seen a good scrub brush in awhile.  Speaking of inoperable things, the elevator is still out of service and again based on other reviews, it's been put for awhile.  \nFast forward to bed time.  Myself, husband and child settled in around 9:30 for bed.  We attempted to set the climate in the room at a comfortable temperature but that hard working unit was either gonna work really well and keep it like a meat locker or the complete opposite. Trying to sleep was difficult between the stomp the yard tutorial that was being held right above us from 9-1045pm and an encore performance from approx 2am to 330 ish.  To be honest my eyes were so bleary I could barely make out the time.  Along with the upstairs noise you can hear very clearly between the rooms as well as all the hall noise.  Soundproofing I think was left out of the remodel budget.  \nThe beds were too hard for our taste but that isnt their fault.  You cant suit everyone's taste in mattresses.  It's hit and miss.\nBreakfast was dismal.  Not enough especially for the capacity.  The odds were not in our favour this morning so we went out. \nStaff still very friendly and helpful during check out.

Didn't make much of a difference; coffee was almost as weak as tea. It seems for weekenders, they do not offer housekeeping services. The heat hardly worked. It was set at a temperature  most uncomfortable for older people. \nGlad we were there for only the weekend. Otherwise, Kingston was a delightful town full of lovely people.",3,negative

I was a little apprehensive about staying here, but as it was basically the only place with rooms available in Kingston under $300 for that night, I decided to see how it was.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I used booking.com to book the room and requested an early check in.  This was not promised, but did happen when I showed up.  I stayed in the single dorm room.  It is just that a dorm room, small, nondescript but cozy and comfortable for a short term stay.  There is a small bathroom with a stand up shower in the room with towels and soaps provided. The bed is pretty comfortable (i like a softer bed).  The beds are twin sized beds so if you are traveling as a couple you'd need a room with 2 beds.  They only thing is that there is only 1 pillow on the bed.  If you are someone that uses more than 1 pillow, then I suggest you take along an extra or do as I did for the night and suck it up.  I didn't ask at the desk if there were extras, so I don't know if that request would have been accommodated.  There is a free breakfast that comes with the room, it is very very basic, coffee, muffin, fruit and yogurt.  The wi-fi was free and pretty good.  As it was Canada Day and the rooms were cheap, I thought that I'd be staying among partiers and have a difficult time sleeping.  It was just the opposite, I didn't hear a sound through the night and when I was checking out in the morning, the majority of other people doing the same and at breakfast were either families or older travelers. As for security, the only way in or out of the building is by going past the front desk, the other doors that exit the building sound an alarm. I would definitely look at staying here again and have recommended it to others.",4,positive

If you are having a short visit to Kingston or, as we were, enroute to catch a flight back home, this dorm room certainly does the trick. Well maybe, come to think of it, if you want something reasonable for a long term stay, this St. Lawrence College Residence room might be suitable as well. I am not sure what options are available, but we had a dorm-style room, two single beds, separated by a shared bathroom. There was a fridge and a bit of counter space, so you could, if desired, have a chance for some food preparation, if you were trying to keep costs down. We were headed to Toronto and catching a flight back to Calgary the next day. We had travelled from Quebec City that day and wanted a chance to see a bit of Kingston and also get us within close range to Pearson Airport. The room was clean, the check-in went smoothly, free wifi was available and there was good parking. Breakfast was included, it was simple, but ample, one yogurt. one muffin, one fruit and washed down with some\""roadhouse coffee\"", (burns up your insides, as the song goes)! So nothing fancy but we (or you) were\u002Fare there to take in the sights, and they are quite bountiful, or maybe to do some visiting. \nWe didn't have a great deal of time for sightseeing, but on the suggestion of a staff member, we did a tour of the downtown and harbour. This area contains many of the 19th century limestone buildings for which Kingston is known, hence its nickname the \""Limestone City\"" -- the most notable being the Kingston City Hall. There are many buildings in Kingston that have been designated heritage properties. Indeed the Rideau Canal, which starts here and the Kingston fortifications were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007. The fortifications include four Martello Towers constructed in the 1840's as a defence against the invasion of Upper Canada by the \""United Staters\"". These are \""cool\"" structures that were built by the British in different parts of the British Empire during the early part of the 1800's. Nearby Fort Henry, again dating back to the early 1800's, was also built as a consequence of this concern. There are also boat tours available which depart from the very pleasant waterfront area. These take you on what is called the Thousand Islands tour or the St.Lawrence tour. This may include a run which offers just sightseeing, or a lunch or a dinner cruise. A short distance away from the downtown\u002F waterfront, you can do a tour of the Kingston Penitentiary, closed in 2013, after nearly 180 years, it is now a National Historic Site of Canada. I think it is quite evident, you will need a few more days at least, to tour the sites of Kingston.\nAnd certainly, as if touring isn't enough, the downtown area also contains many fine restaurants. This is a university town, it has a great many restaurants that cater to students as well as tourists, and of course, appeal to both. We were recommended to seek out the Wooden Heads, located on Ontario Street. There are many likely looking establishments along this road, making for a difficult choice, so the recommendation was nice to have. It was a good choice. \""Wooden Heads\"", as well as inside seating, offers outdoor seating both on the street side and in a very pleasant patio area around back. The menu offers a lot of choices, it appears that pizza is a specialty. We didn't choose pizza, instead opting for the Merluzzo wrap and the La Restituzione sandwich. I won't describe them, but they tasted good, and that's all I can say! Prices were very reasonable, and as noted the surroundings were very pleasant and the servers, likewise. A good recommendation!\nWell, goodbye Kingston, the St. Lawrence College Residence, hope to see you again!\nP.S.

The breakfast is included and there are no parking fees to pay.  The hot breakfast of eggs, sausage, toast, juice and coffee is enough to keep anyone happy until the next meal.

The service at both the front desk and in the breakfast area were friendly and helpful.  It is well located just off the 401, but close to shops and restaurants. \n\nThe not so good:  The breakfast was a little sparse and disappointing.   Only two cereals, strange looking eggs, and no bagels.  It did have a waffle maker though.\nUpon checkout I had to ask for my invoice.  Glad that I did because there was a charge which turned out to be a \""destination fee.\""  I  told the desk worker that this was not included or mentioned to me at booking or check in, and she responded that this is why your total fees are only \""an estimate.\"" She then offered to refund it, which she did and reprinted my invoice.

It is new, immaculately clean, quiet, and right next to the 401.  The beds are comfortable, the free breakfast is great, the wifi works really well, and the staff are excellent - especially the lady running the breakfast, and Carly at front desk! \n\nOne of the other reviewers complained that there are no restaurants nearby.  While you can't see them right outside the window, there are actually lots of them up Gardiners Road, and even more if you drive up to Princess Street (5 minutes away).  But more importantly, I was stumped the first time I was there - so I asked the front desk.  They actually had a printed page of recommendations on local restaurants, all set to go.  Perfect! \n\nIt doesn't really matter what the business is - the attitude of the employees makes a huge difference - and you can't hide it.  The people here consistently do a hundred little things right.  That only happens when management and staff really care about their business.  I think that's why I like this hotel so much, and it will keep me coming back.",5,positive

The receptionist personally went through a number of other rooms checking for a suitable one for us,as the hotel was not full that night. She was gone for about 25 minutes, and came back to tell us that there was the same problem with all the beds throughout the hotel. This is a shame, as this hotel has potential to offer an enjoyable experience, but we won't return.
